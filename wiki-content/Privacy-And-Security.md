# Privacy & Security

Canvas Roots handles sensitive genealogical data including names, dates, relationships, and family history. This guide covers how to protect your family's privacy and secure your data.

## Data Storage Overview

**All data stays local.** Canvas Roots does not:
- Transmit data over the network
- Connect to external services
- Upload information to cloud servers
- Share data with third parties

Your family data is stored in your Obsidian vault as plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. This approach:
- Follows Obsidian's local-first philosophy
- Gives you full control over your data
- Allows easy backup and migration
- Works across all Obsidian platforms

## What Data is Stored

Canvas Roots creates and manages several types of files:

| File Type | Location | Contains |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Person notes | Your configured folder | Names, dates, relationships, cr_id |
| Place notes | Your configured folder | Location names, coordinates |
| Organization notes | Your configured folder | Org names, types, memberships |
| Canvas files | Your choice | Visual layouts, node references |
| Plugin settings | `.obsidian/plugins/canvas-roots/` | Configuration only (no personal data) |

## Privacy Protection for Living Persons

Canvas Roots includes built-in privacy protection for people who may still be living.

### Enabling Privacy Protection

1. Open **Settings** → **Canvas Roots**
2. Scroll to the **Privacy** section
3. Enable **Privacy protection for living persons**
4. Configure the age threshold (default: 100 years)
5. Choose a display format for protected persons

### How Living Status is Determined

A person is considered potentially living if:
- They have **no death date** recorded, AND
- They were born within the configured threshold (default: 100 years)

For example, with a 100-year threshold:
- Born 1950, no death date → **Protected** (potentially living)
- Born 1900, no death date → **Not protected** (over threshold)
- Born 1980, died 2020 → **Not protected** (has death date)

### Manual Override

You can explicitly mark someone as living or deceased using frontmatter:

```yaml
cr_living: true   # Always treat as living (protected)
cr_living: false  # Always treat as deceased (not protected)
```

This overrides the automatic detection based on dates.

### Display Formats

When privacy protection is enabled, protected persons can be displayed as:

| Format | Example | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| "Living" | Living | Clear indicator |
| "Private" | Private | Neutral language |
| Initials | J.S. | Preserves some identity |
| Hidden | (blank) | Maximum privacy |

### What Gets Protected

When privacy protection is enabled:
- **Exports**: Name replaced with chosen format, dates hidden
- **Family structure**: Relationships preserved (allows tree viewing)
- **Notes**: Original files unchanged (protection applies to outputs only)

## Privacy in Exports

### GEDCOM Export

Privacy protection applies when exporting to GEDCOM format:

1. In **Control Center** → **Import/Export** tab
2. Set format to "GEDCOM", direction to "Export"
3. Privacy options appear in the export dialog
4. Choose to exclude or anonymize living persons
5. Export creates a privacy-respecting GEDCOM file

**Example output for protected person:**
```
0 @I123@ INDI
1 NAME Living //
1 BIRT
2 DATE
```

### CSV Export

Same privacy options are available for CSV exports:
- Protected persons can be excluded entirely
- Or anonymized with name replaced by display format
- Dates hidden for protected persons

### GEDCOM X and Gramps XML

Privacy protection also works with:
- GEDCOM X (JSON format for modern applications)
- Gramps XML (for Gramps genealogy software)

## Securing Your Vault

Since Canvas Roots stores data locally, vault security is your responsibility.

### Recommended Practices

**Device Security:**
- Use strong passwords for your OS accounts
- Enable full-disk encryption
- Lock your device when away
- Keep Obsidian and plugins updated

**Vault Protection:**
- Store your vault on encrypted storage
- Use Obsidian Sync's encryption if cloud syncing
- Consider a separate vault for sensitive genealogical data

**Cloud Sync Caution:**
- Understand that sync services (Dropbox, iCloud, etc.) store copies
- Enable 2FA on all cloud accounts
- Consider local-only vaults for highly sensitive data

**Git/Version Control:**
- **Never** commit genealogical data to public repositories
- Use private repositories only if necessary
- Add person notes folders to `.gitignore` if using git

### Backup Best Practices

1. Maintain encrypted backups of your vault
2. Test backup restoration periodically
3. Store backups in a secure location
4. Treat backups with same security as primary vault

## Sharing Family Trees Safely

### Before Sharing

Consider these questions:
- Does the tree include living relatives?
- Have you enabled privacy protection?
- Are there sensitive details (adoptions, paternity issues)?
- Does the recipient need full details or just structure?

### Safe Sharing Workflow

1. **Enable privacy protection** in settings
2. **Export with privacy options** enabled
3. **Review the export** before sharing
4. Consider creating separate "public" and "private" exports

### Sharing Screenshots

Canvas displays full data regardless of privacy settings (protection applies to exports only). When taking screenshots:
- Review for sensitive information
- Consider cropping or blurring names
- Canvas obfuscation mode is planned for a future release

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR (EU)

If your family tree includes EU residents:
- Living EU residents have privacy rights
- Enable privacy protection for exports shared outside your family
- Consider consent when recording living relatives' data

### General Best Practices

- Only record information you need
- Get consent before adding living relatives
- Handle adoptions, paternity, and medical info with care
- Respect cultural norms around family information
- Be mindful of historical injustices in records

## Quick Reference

| Task | How To |
|------|--------|
| Enable privacy protection | Settings → Canvas Roots → Privacy section |
| Set age threshold | Settings → Configure threshold (default 100) |
| Mark someone as living | Add `cr_living: true` to their frontmatter |
| Export with privacy | Control Center → Export → Enable privacy options |
| Exclude living from export | Choose "Exclude living persons" in export dialog |
