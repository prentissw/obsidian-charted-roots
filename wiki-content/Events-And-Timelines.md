# Events & Timelines

Charted Roots provides tools for documenting life events and visualizing them in chronological order. This feature supports both genealogists (who derive events from historical sources) and worldbuilders (who create canonical events directly).

## Overview

The Events & Timelines features enable you to:

- Create **event notes** documenting life events (births, deaths, marriages, and more)
- View **person timelines** showing all events for an individual in chronological order
- **Extract events** from source notes with pre-populated metadata
- Browse a **global timeline** with filtering and gap analysis
- Track **data quality** by identifying missing events and undocumented periods

## Event Notes

Event notes are structured markdown files that document individual life events. They link to people, places, and sources.

### Creating an Event Note

**Using the Command Palette:**

1. Open the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P)
2. Search for "Create event note"
3. Fill out the modal form

**Using the Create Event Modal:**

1. Go to **Control Center > Events tab**
2. Click **"+ Create event note"**
3. Complete the form fields

**Manual creation:**

Create a new markdown file with this frontmatter structure:

```yaml
---
cr_type: event
cr_id: "20251206143000"
title: "Birth of John Smith"
event_type: birth
date: 1850-03-15
date_precision: exact
persons:
  - "[[John Smith]]"
place: "[[Dublin, Ireland]]"
sources:
  - "[[1850 Birth Certificate]]"
confidence: high
description: "Born at 23 Grafton Street, Dublin"
---

# Birth of John Smith

### Event Note Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `cr_type` | string | Yes | Always `"event"` |
| `cr_id` | string | Yes | Unique identifier |
| `title` | string | Yes | Display title for the event |
| `event_type` | enum | Yes | Type of event (see Event Types below) |
| `date` | string | Yes | Event date (ISO format or fictional calendar) |
| `date_precision` | enum | Yes | How precise the date is |
| `date_end` | string | No | End date for ranges |
| `persons` | wikilink[] | No | People involved in the event |
| `place` | wikilink | No | Where the event occurred |
| `sources` | wikilink[] | No | Sources documenting this event |
| `confidence` | enum | No | `high`, `medium`, `low`, `unknown` |
| `description` | string | No | Additional details |

### Date Precision

The `date_precision` field indicates how accurate the date is:

| Precision | Format | Example | Use When |
|-----------|--------|---------|----------|
| `exact` | YYYY-MM-DD | 1850-03-15 | Date known to the day |
| `month` | YYYY-MM | 1850-03 | Known to month only |
| `year` | YYYY | 1850 | Known to year only |
| `decade` | YYYYs | 1850s | Known to decade only |
| `estimated` | circa YYYY | circa 1850 | Approximate date |
| `range` | YYYY - YYYY | 1848-1852 | Date falls within range |
| `unknown` | — | — | Date unknown, use relative ordering |

### Fictional Date Systems

Events integrate with Charted Roots' [Fictional Date Systems](Fictional-Date-Systems). When `date_system` is specified, the date is parsed using that system's era definitions.

**Example with Middle-earth Calendar:**

```yaml
cr_type: event
title: "Bilbo's Birthday Party"
event_type: anecdote
date: "TA 3001"
date_system: middle_earth
date_precision: year
person: "[[Bilbo Baggins]]"
place: "[[Bag End]]"
universe: "Middle-earth"
is_canonical: true
```

## Settings

Event-related settings are in **Settings > Charted Roots**:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Events folder | `Charted Roots/Events` | Default folder for new event notes |
| Show built-in event types | true | Include 22 built-in types |
| Custom event types | [] | User-defined event types |

## Best Practices

### Event vs. Fact

**Events are occurrences; facts are assertions about those occurrences.**

- An event is: "John was born on March 15, 1850 in Dublin"
- A fact in a proof summary is: "I conclude John's birth date was March 15, 1850"

Keep events as discrete occurrences. Use [Evidence & Sources](Evidence-And-Sources) for research conclusions.

### One Event, Multiple Sources

When multiple sources document the same event:

- Create **one event note**
- Add all sources to the `sources` array
- Note discrepancies in the description

### Multi-Person Events

All events use the `persons` array (as of v0.18.0):

- Single-participant events: `persons: ["[[John Smith]]"]`
- Multi-participant events: `persons: ["[[John Smith]]", "[[Jane Doe]]"]`
- The event appears in all linked people's timelines

### Relative Ordering

For events without known dates:

```yaml
cr_type: event
title: "Person A moved to the Americas"
event_type: immigration
date_precision: unknown
after:
  - "[[Marriage of Person A]]"
before:
  - "[[Birth of First Child]]"
```

This enables meaningful timelines even with incomplete research.

### Computing Sort Order

The "Compute sort order" button in the Events tab automatically calculates `sort_order` values for all events based on:

1. **Dated events** - Sorted chronologically by date
2. **Relative constraints** - `before`/`after` relationships create a directed graph
3. **Topological sort** - Events ordered respecting all constraints

**How it works:**
- Click "Compute sort order" in the Events tab
- The algorithm performs a topological sort on the event graph
- Each event receives a `sort_order` value (multiples of 10 for flexibility)
- Cycles are detected and reported (cyclic events can't be fully ordered)

**Benefits:**
- Enables correct sorting in Obsidian Bases without manual numbering
- Respects relative ordering even when exact dates are unknown
- Increments of 10 allow manual insertion of events between computed values

### Groups and Factions

Tag events with groups for filtering by nation, faction, or organization:

```yaml
cr_type: event
title: "Battle of Helm's Deep"
event_type: lore_event
date: "TA 3019"
groups:
  - "Rohan"
  - "Isengard"
  - "Fellowship"
```

**Use cases:**
- Filter timeline exports by faction (e.g., "Show only Rohan events")
- Track events affecting multiple organizations
- Worldbuilding: organize events by nation, guild, or power structure
- Genealogy: tag events by family branch or immigrant group
