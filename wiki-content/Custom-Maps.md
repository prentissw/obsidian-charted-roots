## Overview

Custom maps let you visualize people and places on your own map images rather than OpenStreetMap. Common use cases include:

- **Fictional worlds**: Westeros, Middle-earth, your own fantasy setting
- **Historical maps**: Period-accurate maps showing boundaries as they were
- **Regional focus**: Detailed local maps for specific research areas
- **Thematic maps**: Migration routes, land ownership, parish boundaries

Each custom map is stored as a note with `cr_type: map` frontmatter, containing the map configuration and a reference to the image file.

## Creating a Custom Map

### Map Creation Wizard

The Map Creation Wizard provides a guided 4-step workflow for creating custom maps with interactive place marker placement.

1. Open **Control Center** → **Maps** tab
2. Click **Create Custom Map** button
3. Follow the wizard steps:

**Step 1: Select Image**
- Browse your vault for a map image (PNG, JPG, WebP, etc.)
- A preview of the selected image is shown

**Step 2: Configure Map**
- Enter a map name
- Select or create a universe (optional, for grouping related maps)
- Choose coordinate system (Geographic or Pixel)
- Set bounds/dimensions for the coordinate space

**Step 3: Place Markers**
- Click on the map image to add place markers
- Each click opens the Create Place modal to define the place
- Markers appear with the place name; drag to reposition
- Right-click markers to edit or remove them
- This step is optional — you can add places later

**Step 4: Review & Create**
- Review your configuration summary
- See a list of places that will be created
- Click **Create Map** to finalize

The wizard creates the map note and any place notes you added, then optionally opens the map in Map View.

**Resuming a Wizard Session:**
If you close the wizard before completing, your progress is saved. When you reopen the wizard, you'll be prompted to resume where you left off or start fresh.

### From the Control Center

For a simpler creation flow without the wizard:

1. Open **Control Center** → **Maps** tab
2. In the **Custom Maps** card, click the overflow menu (⋮) → **Create map (simple)**
3. Fill in the map details:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Map name** | Yes | Display name (e.g., "Middle-earth", "Colonial Virginia") |
| **Map image** | Yes | Click "Browse" to select an image from your vault. Stored as a wikilink so Obsidian auto-updates the path if you move the image. |
| **Universe** | No | Group related maps (e.g., "tolkien", "got", "colonial-america") |
| **Coordinate system** | Yes | Geographic (lat/lng) or Pixel — see [Coordinate Systems](#coordinate-systems) |
| **Bounds/Dimensions** | Yes | Define the coordinate space for your map |

4. Click **Create**

The map note is created in your configured maps folder (Control Center → Preferences → Folder locations → Maps folder).

### From JSON Import

If you have a map configuration exported from another vault:

1. In the **Custom Maps** card, click **Import JSON**
2. Select a JSON file from your computer
3. If a map with the same ID already exists, you'll be warned
4. The imported map note is created in your maps folder

---

## Editing Map Properties

To modify an existing custom map:

1. In the **Maps** tab, hover over the map thumbnail
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon)
3. Modify any properties:
   - Change the name, image, or universe
   - Adjust coordinate bounds or dimensions
   - Switch coordinate systems
4. Click **Save changes**

You can also edit the map note directly in the editor — the frontmatter follows the format described in [Frontmatter Reference](#frontmatter-reference).

---

## Aligning a Map Image

Historical and hand-drawn maps often need adjustment to align properly with your coordinate system. The alignment feature lets you interactively position, scale, rotate, and distort your map image.

### When You Need Alignment

- **Historical maps**: Old maps have different projections or orientations
- **Fantasy maps**: Hand-drawn maps rarely align with a coordinate grid
- **Scanned images**: Scanning can introduce skew or distortion
- **Composite images**: Maps assembled from multiple sources

### Entering Edit Mode

1. Open **Map View** (from the Maps tab or Command Palette)
2. Select your custom map from the **Map** dropdown (not OpenStreetMap)
3. Click the **Edit** button in the toolbar
4. The edit banner appears with alignment controls

### Using Corner Handles

When edit mode is active, four corner handles appear around your map image:

- **Drag any corner** to reposition that corner independently
- **Drag opposite corners** apart to scale the image
- **Drag adjacent corners** to rotate or skew the image
- The image updates in real-time as you drag

**Tip:** Start with small adjustments. It's easier to fine-tune incrementally than to fix large distortions.

### Edit Banner Controls

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Save alignment** | Save corner positions to the map note's frontmatter |
| **Undo changes** | Revert to the last saved position (discards unsaved edits) |
| **Reset to default** | Clear all alignment and return to rectangular bounds |
| **Cancel** | Exit edit mode without saving |

### Alignment Workflow

1. **Identify reference points** on your map (cities, coastlines, rivers, landmarks)
2. **Know target coordinates** for those reference points
3. **Start with rough positioning** of one corner
4. **Work around the map** adjusting each corner
5. **Verify with markers** — add a test place and check its position
6. **Save frequently** as you refine the alignment

### How Alignment is Stored

Corner positions are saved as flat properties in your map note's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
cr_type: map
map_id: middle-earth
name: Middle-earth
image: "[[assets/maps/middle-earth.jpg]]"
bounds:
  north: 50
  south: -50
  west: -100
  east: 100
# Saved alignment corners
corner_nw_lat: 48.5
corner_nw_lng: -95.2
corner_ne_lat: 49.1
corner_ne_lng: -58.3
corner_sw_lat: -45.8
corner_sw_lng: -98.1
corner_se_lat: -44.2
corner_se_lng: -55.7
---
```

When corner properties are present, the map loads with that alignment. When absent, the map displays with default rectangular bounds.

## Using Your Custom Map

Once created, your custom map is available in several places:

### Map View Dropdown

1. Open **Map View** (ribbon icon, Command Palette, or Maps tab)
2. Click the **Map** button in the toolbar
3. Select your custom map from the dropdown
4. All places with matching coordinates (or matching `universe`) appear on the map

### Maps Tab Gallery

- Click any map thumbnail to open it directly in Map View
- Thumbnails show a preview of the map image with the name overlay

### Split View Comparison

1. In Map View, click **Split** in the toolbar
2. Choose horizontal or vertical split
3. Select different maps in each pane to compare:
   - Your custom map vs OpenStreetMap
   - Two different historical periods
   - Two fictional regions

### Filtering by Universe

Places automatically appear on maps when:

1. The place has coordinates within the map's bounds, OR
2. The place's `universe` property matches the map's `universe`

This lets you create separate coordinate spaces for each fictional world without conflicts.

---

## Working with Place Markers

Once your custom map is open in Map View, you can interact with place markers directly.

### Dragging Markers

Reposition any place marker by dragging:

1. Click and hold on a place marker
2. Drag to the new position
3. Release to drop — coordinates are saved automatically to the place note

This works with both geographic (lat/lng) and pixel coordinate systems. The place note's frontmatter is updated immediately.

### Right-Click Context Menu

Right-click any place marker to access quick actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Open place note** | Navigate to the place's markdown note in the editor |
| **Edit place** | Open the Edit Place modal to modify name, category, parent, etc. |
| **Remove from map** | Clear the coordinates from the place note (marker disappears) |

### Adding New Places

To add a new place to an existing custom map:

**Option 1: Right-click on the map**
1. Right-click anywhere on the map image
2. Select **Create place here**
3. Fill in the Create Place modal — coordinates are pre-filled

**Option 2: Create from Control Center**
1. Open Control Center → Places → Create place note
2. Set the universe to match your map
3. Add coordinates manually (see [Adding Places to Pixel-Based Maps](#adding-places-to-pixel-based-maps))

---

## Map Actions

Right-click a map thumbnail (or click the three-dot menu button) to access:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Open in Map View** | View the map with all your places and people |
| **Edit map** | Open the Edit Map modal to modify properties |
| **Duplicate map** | Create a copy with a unique ID (useful for variations) |
| **Export to JSON** | Download map configuration for backup or sharing |
| **Open note** | View the raw map note in the editor |
| **Delete map** | Remove the map note (with confirmation) |

---

## Coordinate Systems

Canvas Roots supports two coordinate systems for custom maps:

### Geographic (Default)

Uses standard latitude/longitude coordinates. Best for:

- Historical maps of real places
- Maps that should align with OpenStreetMap
- Places with known geographic coordinates

```yaml
coordinate_system: geographic
bounds:
  north: 50    # Top edge latitude
  south: -50   # Bottom edge latitude
  west: -100   # Left edge longitude
  east: 100    # Right edge longitude
```

### Pixel

Uses direct pixel coordinates with the origin at top-left. Best for:

- Hand-drawn fantasy maps
- Maps with arbitrary coordinate systems
- Images where geographic coordinates don't apply

```yaml
coordinate_system: pixel
image_width: 2048
image_height: 3072
center_x: 1024   # Optional: default center
center_y: 1536
```

### Adding Places to Pixel-Based Maps

When using pixel coordinates, places need `pixel_x` and `pixel_y` properties instead of geographic coordinates. Currently, the Create Place modal doesn't have fields for pixel coordinates, so you'll need to add them manually:

1. **Create the place note** using Control Center → Places → Create place note
   - Set the category to "Fictional" or "Mythological"
   - Set the universe to match your map's universe
2. **Open the place note** in the editor
3. **Add pixel coordinates** to the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
cr_type: place
name: Winterfell
place_category: fictional
universe: got
pixel_x: 450
pixel_y: 780
---
```

**Finding pixel coordinates:**

To determine the pixel coordinates for a location on your map image:

1. Open the map image in an image editor (or use your OS image viewer)
2. Hover over the desired location to see the pixel coordinates
3. Note the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) values
4. The origin (0, 0) is at the top-left corner of the image

**Tip:** If your image editor shows coordinates from the bottom-left, subtract the Y value from the image height to convert to top-left origin.
