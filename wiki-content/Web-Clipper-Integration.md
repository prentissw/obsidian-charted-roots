## Overview

### What is Web Clipper Integration?

Canvas Roots integrates with [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://help.obsidian.md/Clipper), the official browser extension for capturing web content. This integration streamlines the process of collecting genealogical data from online sources.

### When to Use It

Web Clipper is ideal for capturing:
- **Obituaries** from newspaper websites
- **Find A Grave** memorial pages
- **FamilySearch** person profiles
- **Wikipedia** biographies
- **Census records** from online databases
- **Historical documents** from archives

### How It Works with Staging Manager

1. Create Web Clipper templates with special metadata properties
2. Clip content from web pages into your staging folder
3. Canvas Roots automatically detects clipped notes
4. Dashboard shows: "3 clips (1 new), 1 other"
5. Review clips in Staging Manager with filtering
6. Promote verified data to your main tree

---

## Setup

### 1. Install Obsidian Web Clipper

Install the browser extension for your browser:
- [Chrome/Edge](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/obsidian-web-clipper/cnjifjpddelmedmihgijeibhnjfabmlf)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-clipper-obsidian/)
- [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/obsidian-web-clipper/id6720708363)

### 2. Configure Output Folder

**Important:** Configure Web Clipper to save clips to your Canvas Roots staging folder.

1. Open Web Clipper settings
2. Set **Default vault** to your Obsidian vault
3. Set **Default folder** to your staging folder (e.g., `Family/Staging`)

**Why this matters:** Canvas Roots only detects clips saved to the staging folder. Clips saved elsewhere won't be detected or filtered.

### 3. Verify Staging Settings

In Obsidian:
1. Open **Control Center** → **Preferences**
2. Verify **Staging folder** matches Web Clipper's output folder
3. Enable **Staging isolation** (recommended)

## Creating Templates

### Clipper Metadata Properties

For Canvas Roots to detect your clipped notes, include **at least one** of these properties in your Web Clipper templates:

| Property | Purpose | Example Value |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `clip_source_type` | Type of source | `obituary`, `findagrave`, `census` |
| `clipped_from` | Original URL | `{{url}}` (Web Clipper variable) |
| `clipped_date` | Timestamp | `{{date}}` (Web Clipper variable) |

**Note:** All three properties are recommended but optional. Including them enables:
- Detection and filtering in Staging Manager
- Source tracking for citations
- Chronological organization

### Minimal Example Template

```yaml
---
clip_source_type: obituary
clipped_from: "{{url}}"
clipped_date: "{{date}}"
---

# {{title}}

{{content}}
```

### Adding Genealogical Properties

Combine clipper metadata with Canvas Roots properties:

```yaml
---
cr_type: person
clip_source_type: obituary
clipped_from: "{{url}}"
clipped_date: "{{date}}"
name: "{{title}}"
# ... other properties extracted by Web Clipper
---

{{content}}
```

### Tips for LLM-Based Extraction

Based on community testing:

**Use double quotes in prompts:**
- ✅ Correct: `Extract "birth date" from the text`
- ❌ Wrong: `Extract 'birth date' from the text`

**Include Web Clipper variables in context:**
- Helps LLM understand the source material
- Improves extraction accuracy
- Example context: `URL: {{url}}, Date: {{date}}`

**Choose appropriate models:**
- Larger models (Mistral 8B, Small 3.2) perform better
- Smaller models may hallucinate data not in source
- Always verify extracted data in staging review

**Be aware of hallucination:**
- LLM extractors may fabricate missing data (e.g., birth years)
- This reinforces the value of the staging review workflow
- Never blindly promote clips without verification

## Workflow

### 1. Clipping Content

1. Navigate to a web page with genealogical data
2. Click the Obsidian Web Clipper browser extension icon
3. Select your template (or use default)
4. Review extracted data
5. Click **Save to Obsidian**

### 2. Reviewing Clips in Dashboard

After clipping, Canvas Roots detects the new note:

1. Open **Control Center** → **Dashboard** tab
2. The **Staging** card shows: "3 clips (1 new), 1 other"
   - "3 clips" = total clipped notes in staging
   - "(1 new)" = clips added since you last opened Staging Manager
   - "1 other" = non-clipped staging files (GEDCOM imports, manual notes)

### 3. Using Staging Manager Filter

1. Click **Review** on the Staging card to open Staging Manager
2. Use toggle buttons to filter:
   - **All** — Show all staging content
   - **Clipped** — Show only clipped notes (files with clipper metadata)
   - **Other** — Show only non-clipped files (imports, manual entries)

The filter applies at all levels:
- Summary stats recalculate
- Batches (subfolders) hide if they contain no matching files
- Files within batches filter based on metadata

### 4. Promoting to Main Tree

After verifying clipped data:

1. Review the content for accuracy (check for LLM hallucinations)
2. Add or correct any missing information
3. Use batch actions:
   - **Check duplicates** — Find potential matches in main tree
   - **Promote** — Move to main tree (removes clipper metadata)
   - **Delete** — Discard if inaccurate or duplicate

## Community Templates

### Sharing Your Templates

Have a great Web Clipper template for genealogy? Share it with the community:

1. Post in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/discussions)
2. Include:
   - Source type (Find A Grave, obituary, etc.)
   - Template JSON
   - Usage notes and tips
   - Example output

### Finding Community Templates

Check GitHub Discussions for templates shared by other users. Look for:
- Specific source types you research (Find A Grave, FamilySearch, etc.)
- Extraction methods (LLM vs CSS selectors)
- Recent templates compatible with current Web Clipper version

### Official Templates

Canvas Roots provides curated, tested templates in the `docs/clipper-templates/` directory of the GitHub repository.

**Available Templates:**
- **Find a Grave - Person** (CSS selectors, no AI required)
- **Find a Grave - Person (LLM)** (Enhanced with AI extraction)
- **Obituary - Generic** (AI-powered, works on any obituary site)
- **FamilySearch - Person** (AI-powered, handles all record types)

**How to Use:**
1. Download template `.json` files from [docs/clipper-templates/](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/tree/main/docs/clipper-templates)
2. Open Web Clipper extension settings
3. Click **Import** and select the downloaded template
4. Templates auto-trigger on matching URLs (Find a Grave, FamilySearch) or can be manually selected (Obituary)

See the [template README](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/clipper-templates/README.md) for detailed documentation on each template, including:
- Prerequisites and setup
- Fields extracted
- AI requirements
- Usage examples

Community template sharing is still encouraged! Share your custom templates in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/discussions).

## Troubleshooting

### Clips Not Detected

**Problem:** Clipped notes don't appear in Dashboard or filter in Staging Manager

**Solutions:**
1. Verify clip was saved to the staging folder configured in Canvas Roots settings
2. Check that your template includes at least one clipper metadata property: `clip_source_type`, `clipped_from`, or `clipped_date`
3. Reload Obsidian (file watcher only detects files created after plugin loads)

### Dashboard Shows Zero Clips

**Problem:** Dashboard card shows "0 clips" even though you clipped notes

**Causes:**
- Files created before plugin loaded (file watcher limitation)
- Files missing clipper metadata properties
- Files saved outside staging folder

**Solution:** Create a new clip after reloading Obsidian to verify detection works.

### Filter Not Working

**Problem:** Toggle buttons in Staging Manager don't filter correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Verify clipped notes have clipper metadata in frontmatter
2. Check that Web Clipper template is saving metadata properties
3. Try closing and reopening Staging Manager (filter state resets on open)

### LLM Extraction Issues

**Problem:** Extracted data is inaccurate or fabricated

**Solutions:**
1. Use larger LLM models (Mistral 8B, Small 3.2)
2. Improve prompt with double quotes: `"birth date"` not `'birth date'`
3. Include Web Clipper variables in context field
4. Always verify data in staging before promoting
5. Consider CSS selectors for structured data (Find A Grave, FamilySearch)
