## Overview

The Evidence & Source Management features enable you to:

- Create **source notes** documenting evidence (census records, vital records, photos, etc.)
- Link sources to person notes for proper citation
- Display **source indicators** on generated trees showing research quality
- Manage sources with an **Obsidian Bases template**

## Source Notes

Source notes are structured markdown files that document your evidence. They use flat frontmatter properties following Obsidian best practices.

### Creating a Source Note

**Manual creation:**

Create a new markdown file with this frontmatter structure:

```yaml
---
cr_type: source
cr_id: source-1900-census-smith
title: "1900 US Federal Census - Smith Family"
source_type: census
source_date: "1900-06-01"
source_date_accessed: "2024-03-15"
source_repository: "Ancestry.com"
source_repository_url: "https://www.ancestry.com/..."
collection: "1900 United States Federal Census"
location: "New York, Kings County, Brooklyn"
media: "[[attachments/Census 1900 Smith p1.jpg]]"
confidence: high
---

# 1900 US Federal Census - Smith Family

## Transcription

Line 42: John Smith, Head, Male, White, Age 35, Married...

## Research Notes

This census confirms John's occupation as "carpenter" and lists 4 children.
```

**Using Bases:**

1. Right-click on a folder
2. Select "New sources base from template"
3. Use the table interface to create and edit sources

**Using the Import Wizard:**

See [Bulk Source Image Import](#bulk-source-image-import) below for importing multiple images at once.

## Linking Sources to People

Source notes link to person notes using wikilinks in the note body. When a source note contains a link like `[[John Smith]]`, Canvas Roots detects this connection automatically.

**Example source note linking to people:**

```markdown
---
cr_type: source
title: "1900 Census - Smith Household"
source_type: census
---

# 1900 Census - Smith Household

## People in this record

- [[John Smith]] - Head of household
- [[Mary Smith]] - Wife
- [[Robert Smith]] - Son

## Transcription
...
```

Canvas Roots uses Obsidian's `resolvedLinks` to detect these connections, so any valid wikilink from a source to a person note will be counted.

## Source Indicators on Trees

When generating family trees, you can display badges showing how many sources link to each person. This provides at-a-glance research quality visibility.

### Enabling Source Indicators

1. Go to **Settings > Canvas Roots > Canvas styling**
2. Enable **"Show source indicators"**
3. Generate or regenerate a family tree

### How Indicators Appear

- Nodes show badges like "📎 3" indicating 3 linked sources
- **Green badges** (3+ sources): Well-documented person
- **Yellow badges** (1-2 sources): Some documentation
- **No badge**: No sources linked yet

### How It Works

During tree generation, Canvas Roots:

1. Scans all notes with `cr_type: source` frontmatter
2. Counts how many link to each person note
3. Adds small text nodes near person nodes showing the count

This helps you identify which ancestors need more research at a glance.

## Sources Bases Template

Canvas Roots includes a pre-configured Obsidian Bases template for managing sources in a spreadsheet-like interface.

### Creating a Sources Base

1. Right-click on a folder containing source notes
2. Select **"New sources base from template"**
3. A `.base` file is created with pre-configured views

### Included Views

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| All Sources | Complete inventory |
| By Type | Grouped by source_type |
| By Repository | Grouped by repository |
| By Confidence | Grouped by confidence level |
| Vital Records | Filtered to vital_record type |
| Census Records | Filtered to census type |
| Church Records | Filtered to church/parish records |
| Legal Documents | Wills, probate, land, court records |
| Military Records | Filtered to military_record type |
| Photos & Media | Photographs and newspapers |
| High Confidence | Only high-confidence sources |
| With Media | Sources that have media attached |
| Missing Media | Sources without media |
| By Date | Sorted by document date |
| Recently Accessed | Sorted by access date |
| By Collection | Grouped by collection name |
| By Location | Grouped by location |
| Media Gallery | Cards view with media as cover image |

## Best Practices

### Organizing Source Notes

- **One source per document**: Create separate notes for each distinct record
- **Reuse for families**: A census image can link to multiple family members
- **Use descriptive titles**: Include year, type, and key names
- **Add transcriptions**: Keep the original text in the note body

### Naming Conventions

Consider consistent naming for source notes:

- `1900 Census - Smith Family - Brooklyn NY`
- `Birth Certificate - John Smith - 1865`
- `Marriage License - Smith-Jones - 1890`

### Media Organization

For source media files (images, PDFs):

- Store in a dedicated attachments folder
- Use descriptive filenames: `1900-census-smith-brooklyn-p1.jpg`
- Link via the `media` property in frontmatter

## Bulk Source Image Import

The **Import Source Images** wizard helps you bulk-import a folder of scanned documents or photos, automatically parsing filenames to extract metadata and creating source notes.

### Opening the Wizard

1. Open **Control Center** (ribbon icon or command palette)
2. Go to the **Sources** tab
3. Click **Import** next to "Import source images"

### Wizard Steps

#### Step 1: Select Folder

Choose the vault folder containing your source images.

**Filter options:**
- **Exclude thumbnails** - Skips files starting with `thumb_` or `thumbnail_`
- **Exclude non-images** - Skips `.txt`, `.doc`, `.pdf`, and other non-image files

The wizard shows a count of how many files will be processed.

#### Step 2: Rename Files (Optional)

Toggle **Standardize filenames** to rename files to a consistent format based on parsed metadata:

```
surname_given_byyyy_type_yyyy_location.ext
```

Example: `smith_john_b1865_census_1900_usa_ny.jpg`

The table shows:
- **Current name** - Original filename
- **Proposed name** - Suggested standardized name (editable)

Conflicts are highlighted if two files would have the same name. You can edit proposed names to resolve conflicts.

#### Step 3: Review Parsed Data

Review and edit the metadata extracted from filenames:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Filename | Final filename (after optional renaming) |
| Surnames | Extracted family names |
| Year | Record year (census year, document date) |
| Type | Source type (census, vital_record, etc.) |
| Location | Extracted place information |
| Multi-part | Groups multi-page documents together |
| Confidence | Parser confidence (green/yellow/red dot) |

**Editable fields:** Click any cell in Surnames, Year, Type, or Location to correct the parsed value.

**Multi-part documents:** Files with part indicators (`_p1`, `_p2`, `_a`, `_b`, `_page1`, etc.) are automatically grouped. All pages in a group will be linked to the same source note.

**Confidence indicators:**
- 🟢 **High** - Extracted surname + type + year
- 🟡 **Medium** - Extracted surname + (type OR year)
- 🔴 **Low** - Minimal information extracted

#### Step 4: Configure

Set where source notes will be created:

- **Source notes folder** - Destination folder for new source notes (default: your Sources folder from settings)

**Import summary** shows:
- Total source notes to create
- Total images to link
- Multi-part groups detected

#### Step 5: Execute

Click **Start import** to begin. The wizard:

1. Renames files (if enabled)
2. Creates source notes with parsed metadata
3. Links images via `media` properties
4. Shows progress and results

Results display:
- Number of sources created
- Number of images linked
- Log of each created source note

### Filename Parsing

The parser recognizes common genealogy naming patterns:

| Pattern | Example | Extracted |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `surname_year_type` | `smith_1900_census.jpg` | Smith, 1900, census |
| `surname_given_byear_type` | `smith_john_b1865_birth.jpg` | Smith, John, b.1865, vital_record |
| `surname_year_place_type` | `smith_1920_usa_ny_census.jpg` | Smith, 1920, USA/NY, census |
| `surname_given_type_year` | `smith-john-census-1900.jpg` | Smith, John, 1900, census |
| Descriptive | `Birth Certificate - John Smith 1865.jpg` | Smith, John, 1865, vital_record |

**Recognized type keywords:**
- Census: `census`, `cens`
- Vital records: `birth`, `death`, `marriage`, `divorce`
- Military: `draft`, `wwi`, `wwii`, `military`, `civil_war`
- Immigration: `passenger`, `immigration`, `naturalization`, `pas_list`
- Other: `obit`, `obituary`, `will`, `probate`, `cemetery`, `gravestone`

**Multi-part indicators:**
- `_p1`, `_p2`, `_p3` (page numbers)
- `_a`, `_b`, `_c` (letters)
- `_01`, `_02` (numbered)
- `_page1`, `_page2`
- `_part1`, `_partA`

### Tips for Best Results

**Before importing:**

1. **Organize images** in a dedicated folder
2. **Rename consistently** if possible - the parser works best with `surname_year_type` patterns
3. **Remove duplicates** - the wizard doesn't detect duplicate images

**Filename best practices:**

```
thornwood_george_b1843_census_1870_usa_tn.jpg
calloway_1920_usa_ok_census_p1.jpg
smith_john_birth_1865.jpg
```

**After importing:**

1. Review created source notes
2. Add transcriptions and research notes
3. Link sources to person notes by adding wikilinks

## Link Media to Existing Sources

The **Link Media to Sources** wizard helps you attach images to source notes that don't already have media. This is useful when you have existing source notes (e.g., from GEDCOM import) and images that should be linked to them.

### Opening the Wizard

1. Open **Control Center** (ribbon icon or command palette)
2. Go to the **Sources** tab
3. Click **Link** next to "Link media to sources"

### Wizard Steps

#### Step 1: Select Folder

Choose the vault folder containing images to link. The wizard only shows **source notes without media** as potential targets.

A preview shows:
- Number of images found in the folder
- Number of source notes without media available to link

#### Step 2: Link Images to Sources

For each image, select which source note to attach it to.

**Smart suggestions:** The wizard analyzes filenames and scores potential matches based on:
- Surname matches (e.g., "smith" in filename matches "Smith Family Census")
- Year matches (e.g., "1900" in filename matches source with 1900 date)
- Type keywords (e.g., "census" in filename matches census source type)
- Location matches (e.g., "chicago" in filename matches source location)

**UI indicators:**
- **Confidence dots** - 🟢 High (strong match), 🟡 Medium, 🟠 Low, ⚪ None
- **Auto-selection** - Top suggestion is pre-selected when available
- **"+N more" badge** - Shows when alternative suggestions exist
- **Yellow highlighting** - Rows without suggestions need manual selection
- **Summary** - Shows "X auto-matched, Y need manual selection"

**Dropdown options:**
- **Suggestions group** - Top matches with match reasons shown
- **All sources group** - Complete list for manual selection

#### Step 3: Review

Review your selections before applying:
- Summary of images to link and sources to update
- List of all image → source mappings

#### Step 4: Execute

Click **Link media** to apply changes. The wizard:
1. Updates each source note's frontmatter with media wikilinks
2. Uses `media` for first image, `media_2`, `media_3`, etc. for additional
3. Shows progress and results

### Tips for Best Results

**Naming images:** Use consistent naming that includes clues:
- `smith_census_1900.jpg` → matches sources with "Smith", "census", "1900"
- `henderson_obituary_1945.jpg` → matches obituary sources with "Henderson", "1945"

**Manual selection:** For images with generic names like `Document (3).jpg` or `Voice Memo 2020-03-15.jpg`, you'll need to manually select the correct source from the dropdown.

**Multiple images per source:** You can link multiple images to the same source note. Each additional image uses the next available `media_N` slot.

### Confidence Levels

Use confidence to track source reliability:

| Level | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `high` | Original records, official documents |
| `medium` | Secondary sources, family records |
| `low` | Unverified claims, conflicting information |
| `unknown` | Not yet evaluated |

## Transcription Tips

Canvas Roots doesn't include built-in OCR, but you can transcribe documents using external tools:

| Tool | Best For |
|------|----------|
| [Transkribus](https://transkribus.eu/) | Historical handwriting |
| [FamilySearch Indexing](https://www.familysearch.org/indexing/) | Already indexed records |
| Claude/GPT-4 | General image transcription |
| Manual transcription | Difficult handwriting |

### Workflow

1. Create source note with metadata and media link
2. Open image in external tool or AI chat
3. Paste transcription into source note body
4. Add research notes interpreting the transcription
