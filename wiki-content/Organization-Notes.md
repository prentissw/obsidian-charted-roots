## Use Cases

### Tracking Noble Houses
Create organizations for each noble house in your world. Link them hierarchically (vassal houses under liege lords) and add person memberships with roles like "Lord", "Heir", "Castellan".

### Corporate Structure
Model companies with departments as sub-organizations. Track employees' positions and tenure with from/to dates.

### Military Units
Create organizations for regiments, divisions, and armies. Track soldiers' ranks and service periods.

### Religious Orders
Model churches, monasteries, and religious hierarchies. Track clergy positions and affiliations.

## Best Practices

### Use Consistent Type Assignment
Choose the most appropriate organization type for each organization to enable effective filtering and visualization.

### Link Parent Organizations
When creating sub-organizations, always link to the parent organization to build the hierarchy.

### Use Universe Scoping
For fictional organizations, set the `universe` property to enable filtering by fictional world.

### Include Membership Dates
When adding memberships, include from/to dates to track temporal changes in affiliations.

### Use cr_id for Memberships
Include the `org_id` in membership entries for robust linking that survives organization renames.

## Integration with Other Features

### Custom Relationships
Organizations can complement custom relationships. For example, a "liege/vassal" relationship between people might correlate with their house memberships.

### Fictional Date Systems
Organization founded/dissolved dates and membership from/to dates fully support fictional date formats from your custom calendar systems.

### Places
Organization seats link to place notes, connecting your organizational hierarchy to your geographic data.

### Universe Filtering
When filtering by universe, organizations are scoped appropriately to show only those relevant to the selected fictional world.
