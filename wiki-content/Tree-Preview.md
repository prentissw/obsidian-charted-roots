# Tree Preview

> **Note:** This page covers the preview step of the tree generation wizard. For complete documentation, see [Visual Trees](Visual-Trees).

The tree preview step lets you verify your family tree layout before generating output. This is particularly useful for large trees (50+ people) where you want to confirm the layout looks correct.
