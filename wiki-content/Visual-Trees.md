## Overview

Canvas Roots provides a unified tree generation wizard that supports four output formats:

| Output | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Canvas** | Interactive Obsidian canvas file | Exploration, linking to notes, editing |
| **Excalidraw** | Hand-drawn style diagram | Annotation, drawings, SVG/PNG export |
| **PDF** | Printable tree diagram | Sharing, printing, archiving |
| **ODT** | Editable document format | Further editing in word processors |

All formats share the same person selection and tree type steps, then branch into format-specific options.

## Wizard Steps

### Step 1: Select Root Person

Search and select the person who will be the root of your tree.

- **Search**: Type in the search box to filter by name
- **Sort**: Use dropdown to sort by name, birth year, or death year
- **Filter**: Filter by family group, collection, or universe
- Birth/death years appear next to names for identification

Click a person to select them, then click **Next**.

### Step 2: Choose Tree Type

Select the type of tree to generate:

| Type | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Full Tree** | Hourglass | Both ancestors and descendants from root |
| **Ancestors** | Pedigree | Parents, grandparents, etc. (upward) |
| **Descendants** | Downward tree | Children, grandchildren, etc. (downward) |
| **Fan Chart** | Semicircle | Semicircular ancestor display (PDF only) |

Configure generation limits:
- **Ancestor generations**: How many generations up (parents, grandparents, etc.)
- **Descendant generations**: How many generations down (children, grandchildren, etc.)
- **Include spouses**: Show spouse relationships

### Step 3: Select Output Format

Choose your output format:

| Format | Features |

| **PDF** | Printable, shareable, styled boxes and lines, multiple page sizes |
| **ODT** | Editable in word processors, customizable formatting |

After selecting, the wizard branches into format-specific steps:
- Canvas and Excalidraw share similar options (preview, styling)
- PDF and ODT share similar options (page size, node content)

## Tree Types Explained

### Full Tree (Hourglass)

Shows both ancestors above the root person and descendants below:
- Root person in the center
- Parents and grandparents flow upward
- Children and grandchildren flow downward
- Best for showing a person's complete family context

### Ancestors (Pedigree)

Traditional pedigree chart showing only ancestors:
- Root person at the bottom (or left in horizontal layout)
- Parents, grandparents, great-grandparents branching upward
- Binary branching (each person has 2 parents)

### Descendants

Inverted pedigree showing only descendants:
- Root person at the top
- Children, grandchildren branching downward
- Can show multiple children per generation

### Fan Chart (PDF only)

Semicircular ancestor display:
- Root person at center-bottom
- Ancestors arranged in concentric arcs
- Each generation occupies a ring
- Compact visualization for many generations

## Canvas Layout Algorithms

When generating canvas output, choose a layout algorithm:

| Algorithm | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Standard** | Family-chart library layout with spouse handling | Most trees (< 50 people) |
| **Compact** | 50% tighter spacing | Large trees (50+ people) |
| **Timeline** | Chronological by birth year | Visualizing when people lived |
| **Hourglass** | Root centered, ancestors up, descendants down | Person-focused context |

- **Generational**: Different colors per generation level

### Large Tree Handling

For trees that exceed the selected page size:

- **Auto-scale**: Shrink content to fit (may reduce readability)
- **Auto page size**: Automatically use larger paper
- **Limit generations**: Reduce depth to fit selected size
