## Planned Features

Features are prioritized to complete the data lifecycle: **import → enhance → export/share**.

| Priority | Label | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| ⚡ High | Core workflow | Completes essential data portability |
| 📋 Medium | User value | Highly requested sharing/output features |
| 💡 Low | Specialized | Advanced use cases, niche workflows |

---

### Sex/Gender Identity Expansion

**Priority:** ⚡ High — Inclusive handling for writers and worldbuilders

**Summary:** More inclusive handling of sex and gender for writers and worldbuilders, while maintaining GEDCOM compatibility for genealogists. Leverages the existing Schema system for custom value definitions.

**Current state:** The `sex` field follows GEDCOM standards (M/F) for historical record compatibility. The "Normalize sex values" batch operation standardizes variations to M/F.

**Phased Approach:**

| Phase | Feature | Complexity | Description |
|-------|---------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | Separate `gender_identity` field | Low | Optional field for gender identity, distinct from biological sex |
| 2 | Schema-based sex/gender definitions | Done | Use existing Schema system to define allowed values per universe/collection |
| 3 | Value Aliases for sex field | Low-Medium | Expand existing Value Aliases to support custom sex field mappings |
| 4 | Configurable normalization | Medium | Option to skip sex normalization or use custom rules |

**User personas:**
- **Genealogist:** Uses `sex` field with GEDCOM M/F values; optionally `gender_identity` for living relatives or LGBTQ+ research
- **Fiction writer / Worldbuilder:** Custom sex values via Schema, `gender_identity` field, flexible normalization

**Implementation notes:**
- Phase 2 already works—the [Schema system](Release-History#schema-validation-v063) supports `enum` types with custom `values` arrays, scoped by collection/universe
- Value Aliases ([v0.9.4](Release-History#value-aliases-v094)) would need extension to cover the `sex` field
- Export formats would need mapping for non-standard values

See [Sex/Gender Identity Expansion Planning Document](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/sex-gender-expansion.md) for implementation details.

---

### Calendarium Integration

**Priority:** 📋 Medium — Unified timeline experience for fictional worldbuilders

**Summary:** Integration with the [Calendarium](https://plugins.javalent.com/calendarium) plugin to share calendar definitions, eliminating duplicate configuration for worldbuilders. Designed to be invisible to users who don't need it—settings default to off, and no UI changes appear unless Calendarium is installed.

**User Feedback (December 2024):**
- Calendar definition is the main value—users want Calendarium for setting up calendar structure (dates, eras), not primarily for events
- Date ranges (`fc-date` + `fc-end`) are important for lifespans, reign periods, residences
- Pain points with Calendarium include era handling and per-calendar frontmatter fields
- Phase 1 (read-only calendar import) validated as the right starting point

**Integration Modes:**

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Standalone | Canvas Roots manages its own calendars | Users without Calendarium |
| Calendarium Primary | Canvas Roots reads Calendarium calendars | Existing Calendarium users |
| Bidirectional | Full sync between both plugins | Power users wanting unified experience |

**Phased Approach:**
- **Phase 1 (recommended):** Import calendar definitions from Calendarium—delivers ~80% of value
- **Phase 2:** Display Calendarium events on Canvas Roots timelines; support date ranges (`fc-end`)
- **Phase 3:** Bidirectional sync between plugins
- **Phase 4:** Cross-calendar date translation

**Data Mapping:**

| Canvas Roots Field | Calendarium Field |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| `fictional_date` | `fc-date` / `fc-start` |
| `fictional_date_end` | `fc-end` |
| `calendar_system` | `fc-calendar` |
| `event_category` | `fc-category` |
| `display_name` | `fc-display-name` |

**Settings:**
- `calendariumIntegration`: off / read-only / bidirectional
- `calendariumDefaultCalendar`: Which calendar to use when creating events
- `syncCalendariumEvents`: Whether to show Calendarium events on timelines

**API Integration:** Uses `window.Calendarium` global when available, with graceful fallback when Calendarium is not installed.

**Future Consideration:** Per-calendar frontmatter fields (e.g., `mycalendar-date` instead of `fc-calendar` + `fc-date`) to allow one note to have dates across multiple calendars.

See [Calendarium Integration Planning Document](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/calendarium-integration.md) for implementation details.

### Export v2: Full Entity Export

**Priority:** ⚡ High — Completes import/export round-trip with GEDCOM Import v2

**Summary:** Enhanced export functionality that includes events, sources, places, and media in addition to person notes. Ensures round-trip fidelity with GEDCOM Import v2 and enables complete data portability.

**Current Limitation:** All four exporters (GEDCOM 5.5.1, GEDCOM X, Gramps XML, CSV) only export person notes. Event notes, source notes, place notes, and media files created by Import v2 are lost on export.

**Planned Features:**
- **Event Export:** Export all event notes linked to persons (30+ event types)
- **Source Export:** Export source notes with citations linked to events
- **Place Export:** Export place hierarchy with coordinates
- **Media Export:** Bundle media files (images, documents, audio) in ZIP archive
- **GEDCOM 7.0 Support:** Modern format with native media embedding
- **Format-specific mappings:** GEDCOM tags, GEDCOM X facts, Gramps XML events
- **Sensitive field redaction:** SSN and identity numbers automatically removed
- **UI enhancements:** Checkboxes to include/exclude entity types and media options
- **Enhanced export experience:** Progress modal with real-time feedback, export preview with entity counts, and export history tracking

**Supported Formats:**
| Format | Events | Sources | Places | Media |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| GEDCOM 5.5.1 | ✅ inline tags | ✅ SOUR records | ✅ PLAC hierarchy | ⚠️ limited OBJE |
| GEDCOM 7.0 | ✅ inline tags | ✅ SOUR records | ✅ PLAC records | ✅ full OBJE support |
| GEDCOM X | ✅ person facts | ✅ sourceDescriptions | ✅ placeDescriptions | ✅ artifacts |
| Gramps XML | ✅ event records | ✅ source records | ✅ placeobj records | ✅ objects |
| CSV | ✅ event rows | ✅ source rows | ✅ place rows | ✅ media rows |

See [Export v2 Planning Document](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/export-v2.md) for implementation details.

### Statistics Dashboard

**Priority:** 📋 Medium — At-a-glance insights into your data

**Summary:** A dedicated Statistics tab in the Control Center providing quantitative insights across all entity types. Designed for genealogists tracking research progress, worldbuilders auditing consistency, and historians analyzing patterns.

**User Personas:**
- **Genealogists:** Track completeness, identify under-researched branches, spot data gaps
- **Worldbuilders:** Audit character demographics, detect timeline inconsistencies
- **Historians:** Analyze cohort patterns, geographic distributions, temporal clustering

---

#### Core Statistics (v1)

**Entity Overview:**

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Entity counts** | People, events, sources, places, organizations by type |
| **Completeness scores** | % of people with birth date, death date, at least one source |
| **Date range** | Earliest to latest dates across all entities |
| **Gender/sex breakdown** | Distribution with chart visualization |

**Top Lists:**

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Top surnames** | Most common surnames with counts |
| **Top locations** | Most referenced places (birth, death, residence) |
| **Top occupations** | Most common occupations |
| **Top sources** | Most-cited sources |

**Quality Metrics:**

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Unsourced facts** | Count of events without source citations |
| **Orphan entities** | Events/sources not linked to any person |
| **Missing vitals** | People missing birth or death dates |
| **Duplicate candidates** | Potential duplicates by name similarity |

---

#### Extended Statistics (v2)

**Demographic Analysis:**

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Longevity analysis** | Average lifespan by generation, time period, or location |
| **Family size patterns** | Average children per family by generation |
| **Marriage patterns** | Age at marriage, remarriage rates, spouse age gaps |
| **Migration flows** | Birth-to-death location changes, immigration patterns |

**Source Coverage:**

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Coverage by generation** | % sourced facts per generation (shows research depth) |
| **Source type distribution** | Primary vs secondary vs derivative sources |
| **Citation density** | Average sources per person/event |

**Worldbuilding Statistics:**

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Characters by universe** | Breakdown across fictional universes |
| **Characters by faction** | Distribution across organizations/factions |
| **Timeline density** | Events per year/era (spot sparse periods) |
| **Active characters by period** | Who was alive when? |

**User-Defined Property Statistics:**

Canvas Roots supports [user-defined schemas](Release-History#schema-validation-v063) with custom properties. v2 statistics will aggregate these:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enum distributions** | For any schema-defined enum property, show value counts |
| **Numeric aggregates** | For numeric properties, show min/max/average/sum |
| **Boolean counts** | For boolean properties, show true/false counts |
| **Property coverage** | % of entities with each custom property populated |

**Example:** If you define a `nobility_rank` enum with values `king`, `duke`, `baron`, `commoner`, the dashboard shows the distribution across your characters.

---

#### UI Design

**Statistics Tab:** New Control Center tab between Events and Import/Export.

**Dashboard Layout:**
- Summary cards at top (entity counts, completeness %)
- Expandable sections by category (Demographics, Quality, Sources, etc.)
- Charts where appropriate (bar charts for distributions, line for trends)
- Drill-down links to filtered entity lists

**Filtering:**
- Scope by collection/universe
- Scope by date range
- Scope by folder (main tree vs staging)

---

#### v1 Priorities

1. **Entity counts** — Basic counts by type
2. **Completeness scores** — Birth/death/source coverage
3. **Top lists** — Surnames, locations, occupations, sources
4. **Quality metrics** — Unsourced, orphans, missing vitals

---

### Transcript Nodes & Oral History

**Priority:** 💡 Low — Specialized for oral history researchers

**Summary:** Time-stamped citations from audio/video with direct linking.

**Schema:**
```yaml
oral_facts:
  - media: "[[Interview with Grandma.mp3]]"
    timestamp: "1m30s"
    fact_type: birth_date
    quote: "I was born on May 15th, 1922"
```

**Features:**
- Deep links with timestamp: `[[Interview.mp3]]#t=1m30s`
- Range support: `#t=1m30s-2m15s`
- One-click playback from timestamp
- Transcript nodes with speech bubble styling on canvas

**Interview Subject Graph:**
- Map relationship structure of interviews
- Interview as central hub node
- Edge thickness indicates mention frequency

---

## Future Considerations

These features are under consideration but not yet prioritized.

### Unified Property Configuration

**Priority:** 📋 Medium — Single source of truth for all property and value mappings

**Summary:** A dedicated card in the Control Center Preferences tab providing a unified view of all property aliases and value aliases across all note types. Each property the plugin uses has its own row showing the default (canonical) name on the left and an alias field on the right, styled like standard Obsidian settings.

**User Pain Points Addressed:**
- Property aliases scattered across different configuration locations
- No visibility into which properties support aliasing
- Value aliases not transparently showing what maps to what
- Inconsistent behavior when aliases aren't respected in some parts of the plugin

**Scope:** All entity types (Person, Place, Event, Source, Organization, Map notes).

**Design:**
- Collapsible sections by note type to manage the ~50+ properties
- Each row shows: canonical property name (left) → alias text field (right)
- Empty alias fields indicate "using default"
- Value aliases section below property aliases (event types, sex values, place categories, note types)
- Styled to match Obsidian's native settings appearance
- "Show all" toggle vs showing only configured aliases

**Features:**
- Inline validation showing conflicts or invalid mappings
- Visual indicator for configured vs unconfigured properties
- Bulk operations: "Reset all aliases" for a note type
- Search/filter to find specific properties quickly

**Technical Notes:**
- Consolidates existing property alias and value alias functionality into one location
- Existing Preferences tab alias cards would be replaced or redirect to this unified view
- Settings data structure remains compatible (no migration needed)

**Inspiration:** Tasks plugin's unified property configuration approach.

See [Unified Property Configuration Planning Document](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/unified-property-config.md) for implementation details.

### Ghost Nodes for Unresolved Links

**Priority:** 📋 Medium — Visualize incomplete data structures

**Summary:** Display "ghost" or "stub" nodes on canvases for wikilinks in relationship fields that don't resolve to existing notes or notes lacking a `cr_id`. This allows users to visualize the complete intended structure of their family tree or world even when some notes are incomplete or missing.

**Use Cases:**
- **Work-in-progress trees:** See the full intended structure while still creating notes
- **GEDCOM import preview:** Visualize what the tree would look like before all notes are created
- **Research planning:** Show known relationships to people you haven't researched yet
- **Worldbuilding:** Visualize mentioned-but-not-yet-documented characters, places, or organizations

**Scope:** All entity types (people, places, organizations, events).

**Features:**
- Parse wikilinks in relationship fields (father, mother, spouse, parent_place, etc.) that don't resolve to files
- Display stub nodes with distinct styling (dashed borders, muted colors, or "?" indicator)
- Show inferred context on ghost nodes (e.g., if referenced as "father", display "Father of [X]")
- Click-to-create action: clicking a ghost node offers to create the note with pre-filled relationships

**Technical Approach:**
1. During canvas generation, collect all wikilinks from relationship fields
2. Check each link against resolved files and `cr_id` mappings
3. For unresolved links, create placeholder nodes with ghost styling
4. Populate ghost nodes with relationship context inferred from the referencing property

### Research Tracking

Advanced research workflow tools for serious genealogists:

- "Needs research" tags with to-dos
- Confidence levels: verified, probable, possible
- Source documentation per fact
- DNA match tracking
- Research log notes

### Dynasty Management

Tools for tracking succession and inheritance in worldbuilding:

- Line of succession calculator
- Title/position inheritance rules
- Regnal numbering
- Heir designation and succession events

### Sensitive Field Redaction

Automatically redact sensitive personal information (SSN, identity numbers) from exports, regardless of living/deceased status. Currently, sensitive fields imported via GEDCOM v2 are stored but should never appear in exports.

### Data Analysis Scope Expansion

Expand Data Quality → Data Analysis scope options beyond folder-based filtering to include note type filtering:

**Current scope options:**
- All records (main tree)
- Staging folder only

**Proposed additions:**
- Filter by note type (Person, Place, Event, Source, etc.)
- Combined folder + note type filtering
- Note-type-specific validations (e.g., place notes check for missing coordinates, person notes check for missing birth date)

This requires generalizing the `DataQualityIssue` interface to support multiple note types instead of just `PersonNode`.

### Note Creation from Images

Context menu actions to create map or source notes from image files, pre-populating with image link.

### Person Note Templates

Pre-configured templates for different use cases: Researcher (full fields with sources), Casual User (minimal), World-Builder (with universe/fictional dates), Quick Add (bare minimum).

### Accessibility

- Screen reader support with ARIA labels
- High contrast mode
- Keyboard navigation
- WCAG AA compliance

### Obsidian Publish Support

Static HTML/SVG tree generation for Publish sites with privacy-aware export.

---

## Known Limitations

See [known-limitations.md](known-limitations.md) for complete details.

**Key Limitations:**
- Single vault only (no multi-vault merging)
- No undo/redo for Bases edits (platform limitation)
- No bulk operations from Bases multi-select (platform limitation)
- Privacy obfuscation for canvas display not yet implemented
- Interactive Canvas features limited by Obsidian Canvas API

### Context Menu Submenu Behavior

On desktop, submenus don't dismiss when hovering over a different submenu. This is a limitation of Obsidian's native `Menu` API. Potential solutions (flattening menus, modal dialogs, custom menu component) are under consideration based on user feedback.
