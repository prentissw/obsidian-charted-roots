**Screen Reader Support:**
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure in Control Center
- Announce tree navigation changes
- Describe relationship connections

**Visual Accessibility:**

**Features:**
- Static HTML/SVG tree generation for Publish sites
- Privacy-aware export (automatic living person protection)
- Clickable person nodes linking to published notes
- Responsive design for mobile viewers
- Optional password protection recommendation

**Considerations:**
- Canvas files aren't natively supported by Publish
- Would require generating static image/SVG alternatives
- Family Chart View is JavaScript-dependent (won't work on Publish)
- Focus on static pedigree/descendant chart images

**Integration:**
- "Export for Publish" command
- Automatic image regeneration on tree changes
- Embed code for published pages

---

### Style Settings Integration

**Summary:** Expose Canvas Roots styling options via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin, allowing users to customize colors and dimensions without editing CSS.

**Phase 1: Family Chart Colors (v0.8.0)**
- Female card color (default: `rgb(196, 138, 146)`)
- Male card color (default: `rgb(120, 159, 172)`)
- Unknown gender card color (default: `lightgray`)
- Chart background color
- Card text color

**Phase 2: Canvas Node Styling (v0.9.0+)**
- Node width and height
- Border radius
- Border width
- Connection line width and color

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add `/* @settings */` block to `styles.css` with YAML configuration
- Call `app.workspace.trigger("parse-style-settings")` on plugin load
- Use `variable-color` type for colors, `variable-number-slider` for dimensions
- Scope family-chart variables properly (currently `.cr-fcv-chart-container.f3`)

**Dependencies:**
- Style Settings plugin must be installed by user (optional dependency)
- No changes to core functionality; styling-only enhancement

**Not Planned:**
- Spacing variables (internal layout; could break UI)
- Transition timing (edge case)
- Map view styling (Leaflet has its own theming)

---

### Events System Foundation

> **Implemented in v0.6.0** as part of Geographic Features. This general-purpose life events system provides infrastructure for future timeline and research features.

**Current Implementation:**
- `events` array in person frontmatter with `event_type`, `place`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `description`
- TypeScript types: `LifeEvent`, `EventType`, `JourneyWaypoint`, `JourneyPath` in [map-types.ts](../src/maps/types/map-types.ts)
- Event parsing in `MapDataService.buildMarkers()` and `buildJourneyPaths()`
- Import/export support: GEDCOM (RESI, OCCU, EDUC, MILI), GEDCOM X (facts), Gramps XML, CSV

**Future Extensions Enabled:**
- Timeline views (non-geographic chronological display)
- Event-based Bases queries ("all military service events")
- Event notes as first-class entities (like place notes)
- Chronological Story Mapping (see [Evidence & Source Management](#chronological-story-mapping))
- Person Timeline view (all events for one person)
- Family Timeline view (interleaved family events)

---

**Advanced Features:**
- Alternative parent relationships (adoption, foster, step-parents)
- Unknown parent handling with placeholder nodes
- Flexible date formats (circa, ranges)
- Child ordering within families
- Relationship quality visualization (close, distant, estranged)
- Medical genogram support

**Integration:**
- DataView template library
- Advanced Canvas plugin integration
- Multi-vault merging

**Performance:**
- Large tree optimization (1000+ people)
- Incremental layout updates
- Lazy loading for large views

---

## Known Limitations

See [known-limitations.md](known-limitations.md) for complete details.

**Key Limitations:**
- Single vault only (no multi-vault merging)
- No undo/redo for Bases edits (platform limitation)
- No bulk operations from Bases multi-select (platform limitation)
- Privacy obfuscation for canvas display not yet implemented
- Interactive Canvas features limited by Obsidian Canvas API

### Context Menu Submenu Behavior

**Issue:** On desktop, after hovering over a submenu to reveal its contents, hovering over a different submenu doesn't dismiss the first one. The first submenu remains "sticky" until clicked elsewhere.

**Cause:** This is a limitation of Obsidian's native `Menu` API. The `setSubmenu()` method creates native Obsidian submenus, and plugins have no control over their hover/dismiss behavior.

**Potential Solutions (to be evaluated):**

1. **Flatten menu structure** - Remove submenus for items with only 2 options (e.g., "Generate Canvas tree" and "Generate Excalidraw tree" as separate items instead of a "Generate tree" submenu). Keeps submenus only for longer lists (4+ items).

2. **Replace with modal dialogs** - Convert submenu actions to open modal pickers on click, similar to "More options...". More clicks but predictable behavior.

3. **Custom menu component** - Build a fully custom menu system with proper hover behavior. Significant development effort and wouldn't integrate with native right-click.

4. **Upstream feature request** - Request improved submenu behavior from Obsidian team.

**Status:** Deferred - will select approach based on user feedback and Obsidian API evolution.
