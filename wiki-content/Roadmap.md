| Source classification | Primary/secondary/derivative visual indicators |
| Evidence correlation | Proof clusters grouping sources supporting conclusions |
| Conflict documentation | Visual markers for contradictory evidence |
| Written conclusions | Proof summary nodes documenting reasoning |

**Phase 1 (v0.9.0) - Fact-Level Source Coverage:**

New `sourced_facts` property on person notes:

```yaml
sourced_facts:
  birth_date:
    sources: ["[[1850 Census]]", "[[Family Bible]]"]
  birth_place:
    sources: ["[[1850 Census]]"]
  death_date:
    sources: []  # Explicitly unsourced
```

source_quality: primary  # primary | secondary | derivative
```

**Phase 1 Features:**
- Research Gaps Report in Data Quality tab
- Person fact coverage display (which facts have sources)
- Enhanced source indicator tooltips on canvas
- Schema validation for `sourced_facts`

**Source Quality Classification:**

| Classification | Meaning | Examples |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| Primary | Created at/near event by participant/witness | Original vital records, census, contemporary letters |
| Secondary | Created later from memory or hearsay | Family bibles (later entries), obituaries, oral histories |
| Derivative | Copies, transcriptions, or abstracts | Database transcriptions, published abstracts |

**Phases:**

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Fact-level source coverage, Research Gaps Report | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Source quality visualization with color coding | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Proof summary notes and conflict documentation | ✅ Complete |
| 4 | Canvas conflict markers | ✅ Complete |

**Deferred to Future Releases:**
- Source quality borders on media nodes → Style Settings Integration (see below)

**On Hold (Pending User Feedback):**
- Evidence clusters / Research View - Original spec was ambiguous (Obsidian Canvas vs Family Chart View). Three options under consideration:
  1. Add evidence visualization to Family Chart View (D3-based, full control)
  2. Keep current approach (evidence in Control Center detail views)
  3. Create a new "Research View" - evidence-centric visualization separate from family trees

**Integration Points:**
- Extends existing source indicators (v0.8.0)
- Source Media Gallery for evidence browsing
- Data Quality tab for research gap reports

## Future Considerations

### Events Tab (Control Center) ✅

> **Complete in v0.9.2.** See [events-tab.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/events-tab.md) for implementation details.

**Summary:** Dedicated Events tab in the Control Center improves discoverability of Fictional Date Systems and provides foundation for future Chronological Story Mapping features.

**What's Included:**
- **Date systems card**: Moved from Canvas Settings with all existing functionality
- **Statistics card**: Date coverage metrics (birth/death dates), fictional date usage breakdown
- **Event notes card** *(future)*: Placeholder for Chronological Story Mapping Phase 1

---

### Property Aliases

> See [property-aliases.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/property-aliases.md) for detailed implementation plan.

**Summary:** Map custom frontmatter property names to Canvas Roots fields, enabling compatibility with existing vaults and other plugins without requiring property renaming.

**Use Case:**
> "My vault uses 'birthdate' instead of 'born' - can Canvas Roots read that?"

**How It Works:**
- Configure aliases in Preferences: `birthdate → born`
- Canvas Roots reads your property, treats it as the mapped field
- Your frontmatter stays unchanged

**Supported Properties:**
- Date fields: `born`, `died`
- Relationship fields: `father`, `mother`, `spouse`
- Location fields: `birth_place`, `death_place`
- Identity fields: `cr_id`, `gender`, `name`, `nickname`

**Implementation Scope:** Medium - requires updates across all property-reading code paths

---

- Node dimensions are not CSS-controlled; they're written directly to canvas JSON

**Not Implemented:**
- Spacing variables (internal layout; could break UI)
- Transition timing (edge case)
- Map view styling (Leaflet has its own theming)

---

### Events System Foundation

> **Implemented in v0.6.0** as part of Geographic Features. This general-purpose life events system provides infrastructure for future timeline and research features.

**Current Implementation:**
- `events` array in person frontmatter with `event_type`, `place`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `description`
- TypeScript types: `LifeEvent`, `EventType`, `JourneyWaypoint`, `JourneyPath` in [map-types.ts](../src/maps/types/map-types.ts)
- Event parsing in `MapDataService.buildMarkers()` and `buildJourneyPaths()`
- Import/export support: GEDCOM (RESI, OCCU, EDUC, MILI), GEDCOM X (facts), Gramps XML, CSV

**Future Extensions Enabled:**
- Timeline views (non-geographic chronological display)
- Event-based Bases queries ("all military service events")
- Event notes as first-class entities (like place notes)
- Chronological Story Mapping (see [Evidence & Source Management](#chronological-story-mapping))
- Person Timeline view (all events for one person)
- Family Timeline view (interleaved family events)

---

**Advanced Features:**
- Alternative parent relationships (adoption, foster, step-parents)
- Unknown parent handling with placeholder nodes
- Flexible date formats (circa, ranges)
- Child ordering within families
- Relationship quality visualization (close, distant, estranged)
- Medical genogram support

**Integration:**
- DataView template library
- Advanced Canvas plugin integration
- Multi-vault merging

**Performance:**
- Large tree optimization (1000+ people)
- Incremental layout updates
- Lazy loading for large views

---

## Known Limitations

See [known-limitations.md](known-limitations.md) for complete details.

**Key Limitations:**
- Single vault only (no multi-vault merging)
- No undo/redo for Bases edits (platform limitation)
- No bulk operations from Bases multi-select (platform limitation)
- Privacy obfuscation for canvas display not yet implemented
- Interactive Canvas features limited by Obsidian Canvas API

### Context Menu Submenu Behavior

**Issue:** On desktop, after hovering over a submenu to reveal its contents, hovering over a different submenu doesn't dismiss the first one. The first submenu remains "sticky" until clicked elsewhere.

**Cause:** This is a limitation of Obsidian's native `Menu` API. The `setSubmenu()` method creates native Obsidian submenus, and plugins have no control over their hover/dismiss behavior.

**Potential Solutions (to be evaluated):**

1. **Flatten menu structure** - Remove submenus for items with only 2 options (e.g., "Generate Canvas tree" and "Generate Excalidraw tree" as separate items instead of a "Generate tree" submenu). Keeps submenus only for longer lists (4+ items).

2. **Replace with modal dialogs** - Convert submenu actions to open modal pickers on click, similar to "More options...". More clicks but predictable behavior.

3. **Custom menu component** - Build a fully custom menu system with proper hover behavior. Significant development effort and wouldn't integrate with native right-click.

4. **Upstream feature request** - Request improved submenu behavior from Obsidian team.

**Status:** Deferred - will select approach based on user feedback and Obsidian API evolution.
