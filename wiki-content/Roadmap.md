| Source classification | Primary/secondary/derivative visual indicators |
| Evidence correlation | Proof clusters grouping sources supporting conclusions |
| Conflict documentation | Visual markers for contradictory evidence |
| Written conclusions | Proof summary nodes documenting reasoning |

**Phase 1 (v0.9.0) - Fact-Level Source Coverage:**

New `sourced_facts` property on person notes:

```yaml
sourced_facts:
  birth_date:
    sources: ["[[1850 Census]]", "[[Family Bible]]"]
  birth_place:
    sources: ["[[1850 Census]]"]
  death_date:
    sources: []  # Explicitly unsourced
```

New `source_quality` field on source notes:

```yaml
source_quality: primary  # primary | secondary | derivative
```

**Phase 1 Features:**
- Research Gaps Report in Data Quality tab
- Person fact coverage display (which facts have sources)
- Enhanced source indicator tooltips on canvas
- Schema validation for `sourced_facts`

**Source Quality Classification:**

| Classification | Meaning | Examples |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| Primary | Created at/near event by participant/witness | Original vital records, census, contemporary letters |
| Secondary | Created later from memory or hearsay | Family bibles (later entries), obituaries, oral histories |
| Derivative | Copies, transcriptions, or abstracts | Database transcriptions, published abstracts |

**Phases:**

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|

- Checkbox: "Create place notes" (default: on)
- Dropdown: "Place hierarchy style" (flat, nested folders)
- Checkbox: "Attempt geocoding" (default: off)

**Schema:**
```
GEDCOM File
├── @I1@ INDI → Person note + Event notes (birth, death, etc.)
├── @F1@ FAM → Marriage event notes
├── @S1@ SOUR → Source note
└── Places → Place notes (deduplicated)
```

**Integration Points:**
- Staging folder support (import to staging, review, then merge)
- Duplicate detection for places (avoid creating "Dublin, Ireland" twice)
- Property aliases (use configured property names)
- Value aliases (map GEDCOM event types to Canvas Roots types)

---

### Data Enhancement Pass

**Summary:** Upgrade existing vaults by creating missing linked entities from person note data. For users who imported GEDCOM before sources, events, and places were supported.

**Use Cases:**
1. Imported GEDCOM before v0.10.0 (no event notes)
2. Imported GEDCOM before v0.9.0 (no source notes)
3. Have person notes with place strings instead of wikilinks
4. Want to retroactively create event notes from existing date fields

**Planned Features:**

**Generate Events from Dates:**
- Scan person notes for `birthDate`/`deathDate` properties
- Create corresponding event notes (`type: event`)
- Link events to person notes
- Handle existing events (skip duplicates)
- Preview mode: show what would be created before committing

**Generate Place Notes:**
- Extract unique place strings from `birthPlace`, `deathPlace`, and event `place` fields
- Create place notes with parsed hierarchy
- Update person/event notes to use wikilinks
- Merge with existing place notes (fuzzy matching)

**Re-parse GEDCOM for Sources:**
- Option to re-import original GEDCOM file
- Match individuals to existing person notes by name/dates/cr_id
- Extract `SOUR` records and create source notes
- Link sources to matched person notes
- Report unmatched individuals

**UI:**

## Future Considerations

### Events Tab (Control Center)

> **✅ Complete in v0.9.2.** See [events-tab.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/events-tab.md) for implementation details.

**Summary:** Dedicated Events tab in the Control Center improves discoverability of Fictional Date Systems and provides foundation for future Chronological Story Mapping features.

**What's Included:**
- **Date systems card**: Moved from Canvas Settings with all existing functionality
- **Statistics card**: Date coverage metrics (birth/death dates), fictional date usage breakdown
- **Event notes card** *(future)*: Placeholder for Chronological Story Mapping Phase 1

---

### Property Aliases ✅

> **Complete in v0.9.3.** See [Settings & Configuration](Settings-And-Configuration) wiki page for configuration documentation.

**Summary:** Map custom frontmatter property names to Canvas Roots fields, enabling compatibility with existing vaults and other plugins without requiring property renaming.

**Implemented Features:**
- Configure aliases in Control Center → Preferences → Property Aliases
- Read resolution: canonical property first, then falls back to aliases
- Write integration: imports create notes with aliased property names
- Essential Properties UI displays aliased property names when configured
- Bases templates generated with aliased property names
- Full support for all person note properties (identity, dates, places, relationships)

**How It Works:**
- Configure aliases in Preferences: `birthdate → born`
- Canvas Roots reads your property, treats it as the mapped field
- Your frontmatter stays unchanged
- When importing GEDCOM/CSV, new notes use your aliased property names

**Supported Properties:**
- Identity fields: `name`, `cr_id`, `gender`, `nickname`, `maiden_name`
- Date fields: `born`, `died`
- Location fields: `birth_place`, `death_place`
- Relationship fields: `father`, `father_id`, `mother`, `mother_id`, `spouse`, `spouse_id`, `child`, `children_id`
- Other fields: `occupation`, `universe`, `image`, `sourced_facts`, `relationships`

---

### Value Aliases

> See [value-aliases.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/value-aliases.md) for detailed implementation plan.

**Summary:** Extend the Property Aliases feature to support custom property *values*, not just property names. This allows users with existing vaults to use custom terminology (e.g., `nameday` instead of `birth` for event types) without editing existing notes.

**Planned Features:**
- Map custom values to Canvas Roots canonical values
- Initial support for three field types:
  - **Event type**: `birth`, `death`, `marriage`, `burial`, `residence`, `occupation`, `education`, `military`, `immigration`, `baptism`, `confirmation`, `ordination`, `custom`
  - **Gender**: `male`, `female` (+ case variants)
  - **Place category**: `real`, `historical`, `disputed`, `legendary`, `mythological`, `fictional`
- Graceful fallback: unknown event types treated as `custom`
- Unified "Aliases" card in Preferences with property names and property values sections

**Use Case:** Worldbuilders with elaborate taxonomies who don't want to retrofit existing notes to match Canvas Roots' expected values.

**Status:** ✅ Complete in v0.9.4.

---

### Flatten Nested Properties

> See [flatten-nested-properties.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/flatten-nested-properties.md) for detailed implementation plan.

**Summary:** Add a "Flatten" action to nested property warnings in the Data Quality tab, allowing users to convert non-flat frontmatter structures to flat properties with a before/after preview.

**Planned Features:**
- Per-record "Flatten" button in Data Quality results
- Modal with before/after YAML preview
- Underscore-join flattening strategy (`parent_child`)
- Collision detection with warnings
- Support for simple nested objects and arrays of objects

**Example:**
```yaml
# Before (nested)
coordinates:
  lat: 32.753177
  long: -97.3327459

# After (flattened)
coordinates_lat: 32.753177
coordinates_long: -97.3327459
```

**Use Case:** Users who imported data with nested YAML structures, or who have place notes with `coordinates: { lat, long }` format, can easily flatten them for better Obsidian compatibility.

**Status:** Planned.

### Note Creation from Images

**Summary:** Context menu actions to quickly create map or source notes from image files, pre-populating the note with a link to the image.

**Context Menu Actions:**
- **Add map note from map image** - Right-click an image file → Creates a new map note with the image embedded as the map background
- **Add source note from source image** - Right-click an image file → Creates a new source note with the image linked as the source media

**Workflow:**
1. User right-clicks an image file (e.g., `old-map-1850.jpg` or `birth-certificate.png`)
2. Selects the appropriate action from context menu
3. Modal opens with name pre-filled from filename
4. User completes remaining fields
5. Note is created with proper frontmatter and image link

**Use Case:** Researchers who have scanned documents or historical maps can quickly create properly structured notes without manually copying image paths.

**Future Enhancement:** Smart filename parsing to extract metadata (year, location, document type) from structured filenames like `1930-US-Census-VT-Newport-Britch.jpg`.

**Status:** Planned.

### Person Note Templates

**Summary:** Pre-configured note templates for different use cases and user types.

**Template Types:**
- **Researcher Template**: Full fields including sources, confidence, research notes, citation placeholders
- **Casual User Template**: Minimal fields (name, dates, parents, spouse, children)
- **World-Builder Template**: Includes universe, fictional dates, organization memberships
- **Quick Add Template**: Bare minimum for fast data entry

**Features:**
- Template picker when creating new person notes
- Default template setting in preferences
- Custom template creation and editing
- Templater plugin compatibility

**Integration Points:**
- Context menu "Create person note" actions
- Control Center quick-add buttons
- GEDCOM/CSV import (choose template for imported notes)

---

### Accessibility

**Summary:** Ensure Canvas Roots is usable by people with disabilities.

**Screen Reader Support:**
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure in Control Center
- Announce tree navigation changes
- Describe relationship connections

**Visual Accessibility:**
- High contrast mode toggle
- Respect system "reduce motion" preference
- Sufficient color contrast ratios (WCAG AA)
- Don't rely on color alone (use patterns/icons)

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- Full keyboard access to all features
- Visible focus indicators
- Logical tab order
- Escape key to close modals

**Testing:**
- Screen reader testing (VoiceOver, NVDA)
- Keyboard-only testing
- Color blindness simulation testing

---

### Obsidian Publish Support

**Summary:** Enable sharing family trees via Obsidian Publish for read-only web viewing.

**Features:**
- Static HTML/SVG tree generation for Publish sites
- Privacy-aware export (automatic living person protection)
- Clickable person nodes linking to published notes
- Responsive design for mobile viewers
- Optional password protection recommendation

**Considerations:**
- Canvas files aren't natively supported by Publish
- Would require generating static image/SVG alternatives
- Family Chart View is JavaScript-dependent (won't work on Publish)
- Focus on static pedigree/descendant chart images

**Integration:**
- "Export for Publish" command
- Automatic image regeneration on tree changes
- Embed code for published pages

---

### Style Settings Integration ✅

> **Complete in v0.9.1.** See [Styling & Theming](Styling-And-Theming) wiki page for full documentation.

**Summary:** Canvas Roots styling options exposed via the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin, allowing users to customize colors without editing CSS.

**Implemented Features:**

**Family Chart View Colors:**
- Female card color (default: `rgb(196, 138, 146)`)
- Male card color (default: `rgb(120, 159, 172)`)
- Unknown gender card color (default: `rgb(211, 211, 211)`)
- Chart background (light theme): `rgb(250, 250, 250)`
- Chart background (dark theme): `rgb(33, 33, 33)`
- Card text color (light theme): `#333333`
- Card text color (dark theme): `#ffffff`

**Evidence Visualization Colors:**
- Primary source color (default: `#22c55e` green)
- Secondary source color (default: `#f59e0b` amber)
- Derivative source color (default: `#ef4444` red)
- Well-researched coverage color (≥75%, default: green)
- Moderate coverage color (50-74%, default: amber)
- Needs research color (<50%, default: red)

**Canvas Node Dimensions:**
- Info panel directing users to plugin settings (Settings → Canvas Roots → Canvas Output)
- Node dimensions are not CSS-controlled; they're written directly to canvas JSON

**Not Implemented:**
- Spacing variables (internal layout; could break UI)
- Transition timing (edge case)
- Map view styling (Leaflet has its own theming)

### Events System Foundation

> **Implemented in v0.6.0** as part of Geographic Features. This general-purpose life events system provides infrastructure for future timeline and research features.

**Current Implementation:**
- `events` array in person frontmatter with `event_type`, `place`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `description`
- TypeScript types: `LifeEvent`, `EventType`, `JourneyWaypoint`, `JourneyPath` in [map-types.ts](../src/maps/types/map-types.ts)
- Event parsing in `MapDataService.buildMarkers()` and `buildJourneyPaths()`
- Import/export support: GEDCOM (RESI, OCCU, EDUC, MILI), GEDCOM X (facts), Gramps XML, CSV

**Future Extensions Enabled:**
- Timeline views (non-geographic chronological display)
- Event-based Bases queries ("all military service events")
- Event notes as first-class entities (like place notes)
- Chronological Story Mapping (see [Evidence & Source Management](#chronological-story-mapping))
- Person Timeline view (all events for one person)
- Family Timeline view (interleaved family events)

---

**Advanced Features:**
- Alternative parent relationships (adoption, foster, step-parents)
- Unknown parent handling with placeholder nodes
- Flexible date formats (circa, ranges)
- Child ordering within families
- Relationship quality visualization (close, distant, estranged)
- Medical genogram support

**Integration:**
- DataView template library
- Advanced Canvas plugin integration
- Multi-vault merging

**Performance:**
- Large tree optimization (1000+ people)
- Incremental layout updates
- Lazy loading for large views

---

## Known Limitations

See [known-limitations.md](known-limitations.md) for complete details.

**Key Limitations:**
- Single vault only (no multi-vault merging)
- No undo/redo for Bases edits (platform limitation)
- No bulk operations from Bases multi-select (platform limitation)
- Privacy obfuscation for canvas display not yet implemented
- Interactive Canvas features limited by Obsidian Canvas API

### Context Menu Submenu Behavior

**Issue:** On desktop, after hovering over a submenu to reveal its contents, hovering over a different submenu doesn't dismiss the first one. The first submenu remains "sticky" until clicked elsewhere.

**Cause:** This is a limitation of Obsidian's native `Menu` API. The `setSubmenu()` method creates native Obsidian submenus, and plugins have no control over their hover/dismiss behavior.

**Potential Solutions (to be evaluated):**

1. **Flatten menu structure** - Remove submenus for items with only 2 options (e.g., "Generate Canvas tree" and "Generate Excalidraw tree" as separate items instead of a "Generate tree" submenu). Keeps submenus only for longer lists (4+ items).

2. **Replace with modal dialogs** - Convert submenu actions to open modal pickers on click, similar to "More options...". More clicks but predictable behavior.

3. **Custom menu component** - Build a fully custom menu system with proper hover behavior. Significant development effort and wouldn't integrate with native right-click.

4. **Upstream feature request** - Request improved submenu behavior from Obsidian team.

**Status:** Deferred - will select approach based on user feedback and Obsidian API evolution.
