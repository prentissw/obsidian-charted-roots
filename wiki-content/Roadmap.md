### Export Privacy & Sensitive Data

**Priority:** 📋 Medium — Protect sensitive information in exports and UI display

**Status:** Partial — Infrastructure exists, redaction not yet implemented

**GitHub Issue:** [#95](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/95)

**Summary:** Comprehensive privacy protection for sensitive genealogical data during exports and display. Covers sensitive field redaction, user-defined private fields, deadname protection, and improved discoverability of existing privacy features.

**Already Implemented:**
- **Living person detection** — Automatic detection with configurable age threshold (default: 100 years)
- **Privacy display formats** — Four formats: `living`, `private`, `initials`, `hidden`
- **Export privacy protection** — Applied in GEDCOM, GEDCOM X, Gramps XML, and CSV exports
- **Log export obfuscation** — Names, dates, and IDs obfuscated in exported logs (enabled by default)
- **Gender identity model** — `sex`/`gender`/`gender_identity` data model (see [Specialized Features](../docs/developer/implementation/specialized-features.md#privacy-and-gender-identity-protection))
- **Sensitive field identification** — `SENSITIVE_FIELDS` constant identifies `ssn` and `identityNumber` (defined but not yet wired to exports)

**Planned (8 Phases):**

| Phase | Feature | Issue | Status | Description |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Sensitive field redaction | [#96](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/96) | | Wire up `SENSITIVE_FIELDS` to exclude SSN/identity numbers |
| 2 | `cr_living` override | [#97](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/97) | | Manual frontmatter property to override living detection |
| 3 | Underscore-prefix convention | [#98](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/98) | | Treat `_`-prefixed fields as private |
| 4-5 | Deadname + Export warnings | [#99](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/99) | | Suppress `_previous_names`, warn on export |
| 6 | Discoverability | [#100](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/100) | | First-run notice, export dialog warnings |
| 7 | Pronouns field | [#101](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/101) | ✅ | Add `pronouns` property support |
| 8 | Canvas privacy | [#102](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/102) | | Privacy-aware canvas generation |

**Documentation:** See [Export Privacy Planning Document](../docs/planning/export-privacy-sensitive-data.md) for detailed implementation specifications.

### Calendarium Integration

**Priority:** 💡 Low — Unified timeline experience for fictional worldbuilders

**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 complete (v0.12.0) | ✅ Phase 2 complete (v0.15.2) | Phases 3-4 planned

**Summary:** Integration with the [Calendarium](https://plugins.javalent.com/calendarium) plugin to share calendar definitions, eliminating duplicate configuration for worldbuilders. Designed to be invisible to users who don't need it—settings default to off, and no UI changes appear unless Calendarium is installed.

**User Feedback (December 2024):**
- Calendar definition is the main value—users want Calendarium for setting up calendar structure (dates, eras), not primarily for events
- Date ranges (`fc-date` + `fc-end`) are important for lifespans, reign periods, residences
- Pain points with Calendarium include era handling and per-calendar frontmatter fields
- Phase 1 (read-only calendar import) validated as the right starting point

**Integration Modes:**

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Standalone | Canvas Roots manages its own calendars | Users without Calendarium |
| Calendarium Primary | Canvas Roots reads Calendarium calendars | Existing Calendarium users |
| Bidirectional | Full sync between both plugins | Power users wanting unified experience |

**Phased Approach:**
- ✅ **Phase 1 (v0.12.0):** Import calendar definitions from Calendarium—delivers ~80% of value
- ✅ **Phase 2 (v0.15.2):** Display Calendarium events on Canvas Roots timelines; support date ranges (`fc-end`)
- **Phase 3:** Bidirectional sync between plugins
- **Phase 4:** Cross-calendar date translation

**Phase 1 Implementation (v0.12.0):**
- Detects Calendarium plugin installation
- Imports calendar definitions (names, eras, abbreviations, year directions)
- Displays imported calendars in Date Systems card and Create Event modal
- Graceful fallback when Calendarium not installed
- Integrations card hidden when Calendarium not installed

See [Fictional Date Systems - Calendarium Integration](Fictional-Date-Systems#calendarium-integration) for usage documentation.

**Data Mapping (Planned for Phase 3+):**

| Canvas Roots Field | Calendarium Field |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| `fictional_date` | `fc-date` / `fc-start` |
| `fictional_date_end` | `fc-end` |
| `calendar_system` | `fc-calendar` |
| `event_category` | `fc-category` |
| `display_name` | `fc-display-name` |

**Settings:**
- `calendariumIntegration`: off / read-only (bidirectional planned for Phase 3)

**API Integration:** Uses `window.Calendarium` global when available, with graceful fallback when Calendarium is not installed.

**Future Consideration:** Per-calendar frontmatter fields (e.g., `mycalendar-date` instead of `fc-calendar` + `fc-date`) to allow one note to have dates across multiple calendars.

See [Calendarium Integration Planning Document](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/calendarium-integration.md) for implementation details.

### Staging Management

**Priority:** 💡 Low — Review and manage imported data before promoting to main tree

**Status:** Planning

**Summary:** Add a dedicated interface for managing data in the staging folder. The Import Wizard supports importing to staging folders, but there's currently no UI to review, check for duplicates, promote, or delete staged imports after they're created.

**The Problem:** After importing data to staging:
1. No way to see what's in staging from the UI
2. No way to check for duplicates against the main tree
3. No way to promote reviewed imports to the main folder
4. No way to delete rejected imports
5. Users must manually move/delete files

**Staging Workflow:**

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Import to Staging | Import wizard creates notes in staging subfolder |
| 2 | Review | View imported people, check for duplicates |
| 3 | Resolve | Mark duplicates as "same person" (skip) or "different" (promote) |
| 4 | Promote | Move reviewed files to main people folder |
| 5 | Cleanup | Delete rejected staging data |

**Planned Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Staging overview | Display staging folder stats, subfolder list with counts |
| Duplicate detection | Compare staging people against main tree by name/ID/dates |
| Duplicate review modal | Side-by-side comparison with resolution options |
| Promote operations | Move files to main tree, skip "same person" duplicates |
| Delete operations | Remove staging files with confirmation |
| Per-subfolder actions | Check/promote/delete individual import batches |

**Entry Points (Proposed):**
- Command palette: "Canvas Roots: Manage staging area"
- Import Wizard success screen: "View in Staging Manager"
- Dashboard tile (when staging has data)

**Services Available:**
- `StagingService` — File operations, stats, promote/delete
- `CrossImportDetectionService` — Duplicate detection and resolution tracking
- `CrossImportReviewModal` — Existing duplicate review UI

**Documentation:**
- See [Staging Management Enhancement Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/staging-management-enhancement.md) for detailed specifications

### Transcript Nodes & Oral History

**Priority:** 💡 Low — Specialized for oral history researchers

**Summary:** Time-stamped citations from audio/video with direct linking.

**Schema:**
```yaml
oral_facts:
  - media: "[[Interview with Grandma.mp3]]"
    timestamp: "1m30s"
    fact_type: birth_date
    quote: "I was born on May 15th, 1922"
```

**Features:**
- Deep links with timestamp: `[[Interview.mp3]]#t=1m30s`
- Range support: `#t=1m30s-2m15s`
- One-click playback from timestamp
- Transcript nodes with speech bubble styling on canvas

**Interview Subject Graph:**
- Map relationship structure of interviews
- Interview as central hub node
- Edge thickness indicates mention frequency

## Future Considerations

These features are under consideration but not yet prioritized.

### Research Tracking

**Summary:** Tools for tracking research progress toward GPS-compliant documentation.

**Already Implemented:**
- **Research level property** (v0.17.x) — 7-level scale (0-6) based on Hoitink's "Six Levels of Ancestral Profiles," with Edit Person modal, Research Gaps Report filtering/sorting, and Bases views
- **Confidence levels** — Source confidence (high/medium/low/unknown), proof confidence (proven/probable/possible/disproven)
- **Source documentation per fact** — `sourced_*` properties linking facts to sources, coverage percentages in reports
- **Proof summaries** — GPS-aligned proof summary notes with evidence tracking, conflict detection, and resolution

**Potential Future Additions:**
- Research to-do tracking (per-person or per-fact task lists)
- DNA match tracking (cM values, shared segments, match relationships)
- Research log notes (session-based research journals)

See [Evidence and Sources](Evidence-And-Sources) for documentation on existing features.

### Dynasty Management

Tools for tracking succession and inheritance in worldbuilding:

- Line of succession calculator
- Title/position inheritance rules
- Regnal numbering
- Heir designation and succession events

### Universe Batch Operations

Bulk operations for managing entities across universes:

- Move entities between universes
- Bulk universe assignment to existing entities
- Universe merge/split tools

### Import Wizard Filename Parser Enhancements

Extend the Bulk Source Image Import wizard's filename parser to recognize additional naming conventions used by genealogists:

**Enumeration District / Page patterns:**
- `YYYY-recordType_State_County_Locality-ED-p` (e.g., `1880-census_SC_Chester_Baton-Rouge-ED37-p60`)
- Support for slave schedules: `1850-slave-schedule_VA_Henrico-ED12-p3`

This pattern is already documented as a [recommended naming convention](Evidence-And-Sources#page-level-naming-for-multi-page-records) but not yet recognized by the automatic parser. Benefits include:
- Linking multiple families to the same enumeration page
- Supporting FAN (Friends, Associates, Neighbors) research workflows
- Better handling of enslaved ancestor research where context matters

**Note:** Canvas Roots intentionally avoids dictating naming conventions—this would be an opt-in enhancement for users who follow the ED/page pattern.

### Accessibility

**Summary:** Improve usability for users with visual, motor, or cognitive disabilities.

**Already Implemented:**
- **ARIA labels** — Interactive buttons, tiles, and controls include `aria-label` attributes for screen readers
- **Keyboard navigation** — Cleanup Wizard supports arrow keys, Enter/Space activation, and Escape to close (v0.18.11)
- **Focus indicators** — Standard Obsidian focus styles on interactive elements

**Planned Improvements:**
- **Systematic ARIA coverage** — Audit all modals and UI components for missing labels
- **Focus management** — Trap focus in modals, restore focus on close
- **Skip-to-content links** — Allow keyboard users to bypass navigation in Control Center
- **Reduced motion** — Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` for animations
- **Color-independent indicators** — Add icons/patterns alongside color for status (not just red/green)
- **High contrast mode** — Test and adjust colors for high contrast themes

**Testing Approach:**
- Screen reader testing with NVDA (Windows) and VoiceOver (macOS)
- Keyboard-only navigation testing
- Automated accessibility linting where feasible

## Known Limitations

See [known-limitations.md](known-limitations.md) for complete details.

**Key Limitations:**
- Single vault only (no multi-vault merging)
- No undo/redo for Bases edits (platform limitation)
- No bulk operations from Bases multi-select (platform limitation)
- Privacy obfuscation for canvas display requires generation-time application (runtime toggle not feasible due to Obsidian Canvas API limitations) — see [#95](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/95)
- Interactive Canvas features limited by Obsidian Canvas API

### Context Menu Submenu Behavior

On desktop, submenus don't dismiss when hovering over a different submenu. This is a limitation of Obsidian's native `Menu` API. Potential solutions (flattening menus, modal dialogs, custom menu component) are under consideration based on user feedback.
