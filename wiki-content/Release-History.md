## v0.18.x

### Card Style Options (v0.18.15)

Choose from 4 card styles in Family Chart view to match your visualization needs.

**Card Styles:**

| Style | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Rectangle | Default style with avatar thumbnails and full details (name, dates) |
| Circle | Circular avatar cards with name labels below |
| Compact | Text-only cards without avatars for denser layouts |
| Mini | Smaller name-only cards for high-level overviews |

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Style menu | Access via toolbar Style menu → Card Style submenu |
| State persistence | Card style persists across Obsidian restarts |
| Export support | PNG/PDF export works with all card styles including Circle |
| Open note button | Appears on all card styles (smaller on Mini) |

**Technical Details:**

- Rectangle, Compact, Mini use SVG card renderer
- Circle uses HTML card renderer with custom styling
- Circle cards are converted to native SVG elements during export to avoid tainted canvas issues
- State is saved immediately when changing style via `requestSaveLayout()`

**Files Modified:**

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/ui/views/family-chart-view.ts` | Card style state, menu, renderer switching, export embedding |
| `styles/family-chart-view.css` | Circle card styles, gender-based colors |

---

### Edit Person Events & Sources (v0.18.14)

Add events and sources sections to the Edit Person modal, allowing users to manage all person-related data from a single interface instead of editing multiple notes separately.

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Sources section | Multi-value picker to link source notes with Link and Create buttons |
| Source storage | Stores as `sources` (wikilinks) and `sources_id` (cr_ids) arrays for reliable linking |
| Events section | Display events referencing this person with type badges and dates |
| Event linking | Link/unlink existing events or create new events with person pre-filled |
| Type badges | Color-coded type badges for both events and sources matching picker modal styles |

**Data Model:**

- Events use inverse relationships: event notes contain `persons: ["[[Person]]"]`
- Linking an event from the person modal modifies the event note, not the person note
- Sources follow the dual-storage pattern: `sources` (wikilinks) + `sources_id` (cr_ids)

**Implementation:**

| Phase | Feature | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Sources section with multi-value picker | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | Events section with link/create/unlink | ✅ Complete |
| 3 | Polish (type badges, display formatting) | ✅ Complete |

**Bug Fixes:**

| Fix | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Context menu Edit Person | Fixed missing plugin reference causing "Plugin not available" error |
| Children display | Fixed children displaying as cr_ids instead of names (#86) |

**Documentation:**
- See [Edit Person Events & Sources Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/edit-person-events-sources.md) for detailed specifications

---

### Cleanup Wizard Phase 4 (v0.18.11)

User experience refinements for the Post-Import Cleanup Wizard, improving accessibility and feedback during batch operations.

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Batch Progress Indicators | Real-time progress bars during batch operations (Steps 2-6, 10-14) showing current/total count and current file |
| Keyboard Navigation | Full keyboard accessibility: arrow keys for tile selection, Enter/Space to activate, Escape to go back |

**Batch Progress Implementation:**

- Progress callbacks added to all batch methods in `DataQualityService` and migration services
- UI re-renders every 5 items to show progress without excessive updates
- Displays "Processing X of Y notes..." with animated progress bar
- Shows current filename being processed

**Keyboard Navigation Implementation:**

- Arrow keys navigate between tiles on overview screen
- Enter/Space activates focused tile
- Escape returns to overview or closes modal from step view
- ARIA attributes (role, aria-label) for screen reader accessibility
- Visual focus indicators matching hover styles

**Remaining Phase 4 Tasks (Deferred):**

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Step Reordering | Deferred | Drag-drop tiles with dependency validation |
| Cleanup Profiles | Deferred | Save/load named configurations |
| Step Animations | Deferred | Smooth transitions between views |
| Schema Integration | Deferred | Depends on schema validation feature |

**Documentation:**
- See [Cleanup Wizard Phase 4 Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/cleanup-wizard-phase4.md) for detailed specifications

---

### Property Naming Normalization (v0.18.11)

Standardized property naming for consistency and Obsidian compatibility, completing the `child` → `children` migration.

**Problem Solved:**

The codebase had inconsistent naming for the children wikilink property:
- `child` (singular) - legacy, used by older code paths
- `children` (plural) - preferred, matches `children_id`

This caused duplicate properties to appear in YAML when both systems wrote to the same note.

**Solution:**

| Component | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| Cleanup Wizard Step 14 | Batch migrate `child` → `children` across vault with preview |
| Documentation | `children` marked as canonical in Frontmatter-Reference.md |
| Deprecation Notice | Clear deprecation note with migration instructions |
| Wizard Extensibility | Fixed hardcoded step count to use `WIZARD_STEPS.length` |

**Migration Logic:**
- Detects person notes with legacy `child` property
- Merges with existing `children` if both exist (deduplicates)
- Removes legacy `child` property after migration

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Plugin reads both `child` and `children` during transition
- Future breaking change to remove `child` read support planned

**Documentation:**
- See [Deprecate Child Property Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/deprecate-child-property.md) for detailed specifications

### Custom Map Authoring (v0.18.10)

Streamlined custom map creation and place positioning, eliminating manual coordinate entry.

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Map Creation Wizard | 4-step guided wizard: select image → configure map → add initial places → review & create |
| Right-Click to Create Place | Right-click on custom map → "Create place here" → coordinates auto-filled |
| Draggable Place Markers | Drag markers to reposition (edit mode required), auto-update frontmatter, undo support |
| Place Marker Context Menu | Right-click markers to edit, open note, or copy coordinates |
| Icon-Only Toolbar | Map View toolbar buttons converted to icons with tooltips for space efficiency |

**Map Creation Wizard Steps:**
1. **Select Image** — Browse vault for map image with preview and auto-detected dimensions
2. **Configure Map** — Set name, universe (optional), coordinate system (pixel default for fantasy maps)
3. **Add Places** — Click on map preview to add initial locations (optional, can skip)
4. **Review & Create** — Summary view, then create map note and all place notes at once

**Entry Points:**
- Control Center → Maps → "Create map wizard"
- Command palette: "Canvas Roots: Create custom map"
- Context menu on image files: "Use as custom map"

**Technical Notes:**
- Wizard supports inline universe creation
- Modal state persistence allows resuming interrupted sessions
- Coordinates properly convert between DOM (y=0 at top) and Leaflet Simple CRS (y=0 at bottom)

**Documentation:**
- See [Custom Map Authoring Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/custom-map-authoring.md) for detailed specifications

---

### Nested Properties Redesign (v0.18.9)

Redesigned two features to use Obsidian-compatible flat property formats, eliminating "Type mismatch" warnings in the Properties panel and preventing data corruption.

**Problem Solved:**

Two plugin features used nested YAML structures incompatible with Obsidian's property panel:
- `sourced_facts` (Evidence Tracking) - nested objects with source arrays
- `events` (Life Events) - inline array of event objects

This caused "Type mismatch" warnings and risked data corruption if users clicked "update" in the property panel. ([GitHub Issue #52](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/52))

**Solution:**

**1. Evidence Tracking → Flat Properties**

Replaced nested `sourced_facts` object with individual flat properties:

```yaml
# Old format (nested - incompatible)
sourced_facts:
  birth_date:
    sources:
      - "[[Census 1870]]"
  death_date:
    sources:
      - "[[Death Certificate]]"

# New format (flat - compatible)
sourced_birth_date:
  - "[[Census 1870]]"
sourced_death_date:
  - "[[Death Certificate]]"
```

10 flat properties for each fact type:
- `sourced_birth_date`, `sourced_birth_place`
- `sourced_death_date`, `sourced_death_place`
- `sourced_parents`, `sourced_spouse`
- `sourced_marriage_date`, `sourced_marriage_place`
- `sourced_occupation`, `sourced_residence`

**2. Life Events → Event Note Files**

Replaced inline `events` array with separate event note files:

```yaml
# Old format (inline array - incompatible)
events:
  - event_type: residence
    place: "[[New York]]"
    date_from: "1920"

# New format (event note links - compatible)
life_events:
  - "[[Events/John Smith - Residence 1920]]"
```

Each event becomes a first-class note with full frontmatter, enabling:
- Searchability and linking
- Tags and attachments
- Source citations per event
- Organized in Events folder

**3. Cleanup Wizard Integration**

Added two new migration steps (now 13-step wizard):

| Step | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 12 | Migrate Evidence Tracking | Convert `sourced_facts` → `sourced_*` flat properties |
| 13 | Migrate Life Events | Convert inline `events` → event note files with `life_events` links |

**4. Migration Notice (v0.18.9)**

- Shows on upgrade to v0.18.9+
- Explains both migrations with before/after examples
- Checkmarks indicate completed migrations
- "Open Cleanup Wizard" button for migration
- "Skip for now" button as escape hatch

**5. Backward Compatibility**

- Plugin reads both old and new formats during transition
- Old data continues to work until migrated
- Migration can be done at user's convenience

**Benefits:**
- No more "Type mismatch" warnings in Properties panel
- Safe to edit properties without data corruption
- Better Dataview and Bases compatibility
- Each event as a note enables linking, tags, and attachments

**Files Changed:**
- `src/sources/types/source-types.ts` - New property types and mappings
- `src/types/frontmatter.ts` - New `sourced_*` and `life_events` properties
- `src/sources/services/evidence-service.ts` - Dual-format reading
- `src/ui/control-center.ts` - Write to flat properties
- `src/sources/services/sourced-facts-migration-service.ts` - Step 12 migration
- `src/events/services/life-events-migration-service.ts` - Step 13 migration
- `src/ui/cleanup-wizard-modal.ts` - Steps 12 and 13
- `src/ui/views/migration-notice-view.ts` - v0.18.9 notice
- `src/settings.ts` - Migration completion tracking

---

### Inclusive Parent Relationships (v0.18.7)

Opt-in gender-neutral parent relationship support allowing users to represent diverse family structures while preserving traditional father/mother fields.

**Problem Solved:**

Users with nonbinary parents or those who prefer gender-neutral terminology had no way to represent these relationships. The plugin only supported gendered parent fields (father/mother), which doesn't accommodate all family structures.

**User Request:** "What if one or both parents are nonbinary? Could you add a 'Parent' option to father/mother?" ([GitHub Issue #63](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/63))

**Solution:**

A complete opt-in gender-neutral parent system that coexists with traditional relationships:

**1. Settings (Control Center > Preferences)**
- **Enable Inclusive Parents** toggle (default: OFF)
- **Parent Field Label** text setting for customization (default: "Parents")
  - Examples: "Parents", "Guardians", "Progenitors", "Lolos"
  - Label shown in UI only; frontmatter always uses `parents` property
- Conditional visibility: label setting only shown when toggle enabled

**2. Schema Changes**
- New `parents` property (wikilinks, can be array for multiple parents)
- New `parents_id` property (Canvas Roots IDs, dual storage pattern)
- Independent of `father`/`mother` — users can use either or both
- Supports mixed usage for blended families or migration scenarios

**3. Create/Edit Person Modal**
- Parents field appears when setting enabled (above father/mother)
- Multi-select person picker (same pattern as children field)
- Inline parent creation via person picker
- No gender pre-fill (unlike father/mother)
- Uses custom label from settings

**4. Family Graph Integration**
- FamilyGraphService reads `parents`/`parents_id` relationships
- Included in ancestor/descendant calculations
- Same treatment as father/mother for graph traversal
- Spouse edges between 2 parents (same pattern as father/mother)
- Priority order for fallback: biological → gender-neutral → adoptive

**5. Bidirectional Linking**
- When person added to `parents` array, automatically adds to each parent's `children` array
- Uses dual storage: both wikilinks (`parents`) and IDs (`parents_id`)
- Deduplication prevents duplicate entries
- Handles removal: when parent removed, child removed from their `children`
- Supports aliased wikilinks (`[[basename|name]]`) when filename differs from name

**6. Relationship Displays**
- **Relationships Block** (`canvas-roots-relationships`): Shows parents with "Parent" label
- **Family Chart View**: Displays gender-neutral parents in interactive tree
- **Sibling Detection**: Checks gender-neutral parents' children for siblings

**Design Principles:**

1. **Opt-in, not replacement** — Father/mother fields remain; this adds alongside
2. **Configurable** — Users customize terminology to their preference
3. **Non-disruptive** — Users with traditional setups see no UI changes
4. **Coexistent** — Can use father, mother, AND parents simultaneously

**Schema Example:**

```yaml
# Child's note
name: Jamie Smith
parents:
  - "[[Alex Smith]]"
  - "[[Jordan Smith]]"
parents_id:
  - "I0045"
  - "I0046"
```

```yaml
# Parent's note (automatically updated via bidirectional linking)
name: Alex Smith
children:
  - "[[Jamie Smith]]"
children_id:
  - "I0050"
```

**Implementation:**

**Files Modified:**
- [src/settings.ts](../../src/settings.ts) — Settings schema and UI
- [src/types/frontmatter.ts](../../src/types/frontmatter.ts#L62-L63) — Schema definition
- [src/core/family-graph.ts](../../src/core/family-graph.ts#L48) — Family graph integration
- [src/core/bidirectional-linker.ts](../../src/core/bidirectional-linker.ts#L227-L241) — Bidirectional sync
- [src/core/person-note-writer.ts](../../src/core/person-note-writer.ts#L393-L412) — Frontmatter writing
- [src/dynamic-content/renderers/relationships-renderer.ts](../../src/dynamic-content/renderers/relationships-renderer.ts#L150-L156) — Relationships display
- [src/ui/views/family-chart-view.ts](../../src/ui/views/family-chart-view.ts#L1090-L1097) — Family Chart View

**User Benefits:**
- Represents nonbinary parents respectfully
- Supports diverse family structures (queer families, cultural variations)
- Fully customizable terminology
- Backward compatible — no disruption to existing workflows
- Full integration across all family graph features

**Technical Details:**

**Dual Storage Pattern:**
```yaml
# Both wikilinks and IDs stored for flexibility
parents: ["[[Alex Smith]]"]  # For display and linking
parents_id: ["I0045"]         # For reliable graph traversal
```

**Priority Order (Fallback Logic):**
1. Check biological parents (father/mother)
2. If none, check gender-neutral parents
3. If none, check adoptive parents

**Bidirectional Sync:**
- Uses same `children` array as father/mother relationships
- Each parent in `parents` array gets child added to their `children`
- Deduplication by both cr_id and wikilink
- Deletion detection for relationship cleanup

### Media Upload and Management Enhancement (v0.18.6)

Comprehensive media upload and management system allowing users to upload files directly from Canvas Roots and link them to entities without manual file management.

**Problem Solved:**

Users could link existing vault files to entities (people, places, events, etc.), but had no way to upload new files directly from the plugin. This required breaking the workflow to manually add files to the vault before linking them, creating friction when attaching scanned documents, photos, or certificates to research.

**User Request:** "Can't link the Birth Certificate or picture" ([GitHub Issue #60](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/60))

**Solution:**

A complete media upload and linking system with multiple workflows:

**1. Settings Enhancement**
- Drag-and-drop reordering of media folders in Preferences
- First folder in list becomes upload destination
- Visual feedback during drag operations

**2. Expanded Media Manager Dashboard**
- 6-tile layout (3×2 grid) vs. previous 4-tile layout
- **Row 1 (Browse & Discover):**
  - Linked Media Gallery — view all linked media with filters
  - Find Unlinked — discover orphaned media files
  - Source Media Linker — smart filename-based matching
- **Row 2 (Add & Link):**
  - Upload Media — standalone file upload with optional linking
  - Link Media — media-first workflow (select files → choose entities)
  - Bulk Link to Entities — entity-first workflow (select entities → choose files)

**3. Standalone Upload Modal**
- Drag-and-drop file upload with browse fallback
- Upload to first configured media folder
- Read-only destination display with helpful hint
- Multiple file selection
- Auto-rename collision handling (incremental numbering)
- File type validation
- Optional entity linking after upload

**4. Inline Upload in Media Picker**
- "Upload files..." button in MediaPickerModal
- Follows PlacePickerModal "Create new place" pattern
- Auto-selects newly uploaded files
- Available in both context menu and Dashboard workflows

**5. Entity Picker Modal**
- Select entities after choosing media files (media-first workflow)
- Supports all entity types: Person, Event, Place, Organization, Source
- **Person-specific filters:**
  - Living status: All / Living only / Deceased only
  - Birth date: All / Has date / Missing date
  - Sex: All / Male / Female
- **Person-specific sorting:**
  - Name (A-Z / Z-A)
  - Birth year (oldest first / youngest first)
  - Recently modified
- Shows which entities already have selected media linked
- Bulk linking with progress modal for ≥5 entities

**6. Consistent Upload Availability**
- Context menu flow: Right-click entity → Media → Link media → Upload files
- Media Manager tile: Link Media → Upload files
- Both workflows use same enhanced MediaPickerModal

**Architecture:**

**"Read Many, Write One" model:**
- Files upload to `mediaFolders[0]` (first configured folder)
- MediaPickerModal browses ALL media folders
- Users can reorganize files later via Obsidian's file explorer
- Drag-and-drop reordering in settings allows changing upload destination

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Media folders separate from maps folder (maps via place map picker)
- No destination dropdown (simplified UX, predictable behavior)
- Auto-rename collision handling vs. prompting user
- Inline upload in existing modals vs. separate upload-only modal

**Implementation:**

**Files Created:**
- `src/core/ui/media-upload-modal.ts` (302 lines) — Standalone upload modal
- `src/core/ui/entity-picker-modal.ts` (608 lines) — Entity selection with filtering

**Files Modified:**
- `src/ui/preferences-tab.ts` — Drag-and-drop reordering
- `src/core/ui/media-manager-modal.ts` — 6-tile layout
- `src/core/ui/media-picker-modal.ts` — Inline upload button
- `main.ts` — Context menu upload support
- `styles/preferences.css` — Folder reordering styles
- `styles/media-modals.css` — Upload and entity picker styles

**User Benefits:**
- No context switching to add files to vault
- Streamlined workflow for attaching documents to research
- Consistent upload experience across all entry points
- Visual media folder management in settings
- Powerful entity selection with filters for media-first workflows

**Technical Details:**

Uses Obsidian Vault API:
```typescript
await this.app.vault.createBinary(path, arrayBuffer)
```

Auto-rename collision handling:
- `photo.jpg` → `photo 1.jpg` → `photo 2.jpg` (incremental)
- Prevents overwrite accidents
- Allows quick bulk uploads without manual renaming

### Timeline Export Consolidation (v0.18.2)

Consolidated all timeline export functionality from the Events tab Export card into the unified Reports wizard, creating a single comprehensive experience with all 8 export formats.

**Problem Solved:**

Timeline exports existed in two separate locations with different capabilities:

| Location | Formats | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Events tab → Export card | Canvas, Excalidraw, 4 markdown formats | Visual exports, styling options | No PDF/ODT, no date range filter |
| Reports → Timeline | PDF, ODT, markdown table | Document exports, advanced filters | No Canvas/Excalidraw, limited markdown |

Users had to navigate between two different UIs to access the full range of export options.

**Solution:**

All timeline export capabilities are now unified in **Statistics & Reports → Reports → Timeline**:

| Category | Formats |
|----------|---------|
| Visual exports | Canvas, Excalidraw (requires Excalidraw plugin) |
| Documents | PDF, ODT |
| Markdown | Vertical timeline (callouts), Table, Simple list, Dataview query |

**Consolidated Features:**

| Feature | Source |
|---------|--------|
| All filters | Person, event type, group, place, universe, date range |
| Canvas/Excalidraw styling | Layout (horizontal/vertical/Gantt), color scheme, ordering edges |
| Excalidraw drawing options | Style, font, stroke width |
| PDF/ODT options | Page size, date format, cover page |
| Grouping options | None, by year, by decade, by person, by place |
| Data quality insights | Timeline gaps, unsourced events, orphan events |

**Implementation Phases:**

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Add Canvas, Excalidraw, and additional markdown formats to Reports Timeline | ✓ Complete |
| 2 | Redesign wizard steps for format selection and format-specific options | ✓ Complete |
| 3 | Add deprecation notice to Events tab Export card | ✓ Complete |

**Deprecation Notice:**

The Events tab Export card now displays a notice directing users to the Reports wizard. The Export card will be removed in a future release.

**Documentation:**
- See [Timeline Export Consolidation Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/timeline-export-consolidation.md) for detailed specifications

### Create Person Enhancements (v0.18.1)

A comprehensive set of enhancements to streamline family tree creation, addressing the tedious workflow of jumping in and out of modals when building a family tree from scratch.

**Problem Solved:**

Building a family tree required constant context-switching:
1. Create Person A → Save → Close
2. Create Person B → Save → Close
3. Edit Person A to link B as spouse → Save → Close
4. Create Child C → Save → Close
5. Edit Child C to set parents → Save → Close
6. ...repeat endlessly

**Solution:**

Four phases of enhancements enable continuous family creation without leaving the modal flow.

**Phase 1: Inline Person Creation**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| "Create new" in pickers | When selecting father/mother/spouse, offer "Create new person" option |

### Event Person Property Consolidation (v0.18.0)

Consolidates the dual `person`/`persons` event properties into a single unified `persons` array format for all event types.

**Problem Solved:**

Event notes previously used two different properties to track participants:
- `person` (string): Single participant for individual events (birth, death, occupation)
- `persons` (array): Multiple participants for family events (marriage, divorce, residence)

This duality created complexity in base templates (required formula workarounds), importers (must decide which property to use), and user understanding.

**Solution:**

All events now use the `persons` array property. Single-participant events simply have an array with one element:

```yaml
# Single-participant event
persons:
  - "[[John Smith]]"

# Multi-participant event
persons:
  - "[[John Smith]]"
  - "[[Jane Doe]]"
```

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Unified Property** | All importers (GEDCOM, Gramps, GEDCOM X) now write `persons` array |
| **Migration Wizard Step** | Cleanup Wizard Step 11 detects and migrates legacy `person` properties |
| **Backward Compatibility** | Base templates and services continue reading both properties |
| **Migration Notice** | Users upgrading from v0.17.x see a one-time notice with migration guidance |

**Migration:**

1. Open the Cleanup Wizard (Control Center → Data Quality, or command palette)
2. Navigate to Step 11: "Migrate Event Person Properties"
3. Review detected notes and click "Apply All"

The legacy `person` property continues to be read indefinitely for backward compatibility.

**Documentation:**
- [Events And Timelines](Events-And-Timelines) - Updated property documentation
- [Frontmatter Reference](Frontmatter-Reference#person-and-place-links) - Updated event properties

## v0.17.x

### Research Level Property (v0.17.5)

A `research_level` property for Person notes to track research progress toward GPS-compliant documentation. Based on Yvette Hoitink's "Six Levels of Ancestral Profiles" system.

**Problem Solved:**

Genealogists need a way to track how thoroughly each ancestor has been researched, supporting the GPS principle of "reasonably exhaustive research." Previously, there was no standardized way to indicate which ancestors need more work.

**Research Levels:**

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Unidentified | Ancestor exists but no name established (placeholder) |
| 1 | Name Only | Name known, appears in others' records, no vital dates |
| 2 | Vital Statistics | Birth, marriage, death dates researched |
| 3 | Life Events | Occupations, residences, children, spouses documented |
| 4 | Extended Records | Property, military, religion, legal records researched |
| 5 | GPS Complete | Exhaustive research complete, written proof summary exists |
| 6 | Biography | Full narrative biography with historical context |

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Edit Modal Selector** | Dropdown in Create/Edit Person modal to set research level |
| **Research Gaps Report** | Filter/sort by level, show statistics by level range |
| **Bases Views** | "By research level" grouped view, "Needs research" filtered view |
| **GEDCOM Export** | `_RESEARCH_LEVEL` custom tag |
| **Gramps Export** | `<attribute type="Research Level">` element |
| **Round-trip Import** | Both formats import back into `research_level` property |

**UI Integration:**

The research level selector appears in the Edit Person modal when `trackFactSourcing` is enabled in settings. The "(Not assessed)" option allows distinguishing between "not yet evaluated" and "Level 0 (Unidentified)".

**Files Modified:**

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/types/frontmatter.ts` | ResearchLevel type, RESEARCH_LEVELS metadata |
| `src/core/person-note-writer.ts` | researchLevel in PersonData |
| `src/ui/create-person-modal.ts` | Dropdown selector |
| `src/core/family-graph.ts` | researchLevel in PersonNode |
| `src/reports/services/gaps-report-generator.ts` | Filtering, sorting, statistics |
| `src/gedcom/gedcom-exporter.ts` | `_RESEARCH_LEVEL` export |
| `src/gramps/gramps-exporter.ts` | "Research Level" attribute export |
| `src/gedcom/gedcom-parser-v2.ts` | Import parsing |
| `src/gramps/gramps-parser.ts` | Import parsing |

### Excalidraw Export Enhancements (v0.17.1)

Enhanced Excalidraw export with ExcalidrawAutomate API integration, style customization, and improved output quality.

**Problem Solved:**

The previous Excalidraw export was functional but limited:
- **Manual text sizing:** Text dimensions estimated with character width multiplier, often inaccurate
- **Static arrows:** Connections didn't adapt when elements were moved in Excalidraw
- **No wiki links:** Couldn't click nodes to navigate to person notes
- **No style control:** Fixed visual style with no customization options
- **Temp file pollution:** Intermediate canvas files left behind after export

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **ExcalidrawAutomate API** | Uses API when available for smart connectors and accurate text measurement |
| **Smart connectors** | Arrows adapt when elements are moved (API mode) |
| **Wiki links** | Nodes link to person notes via Excalidraw's link property |
| **Spouse styling** | Spouse relationships rendered with dashed lines |
| **Drawing style options** | Architect (clean), Artist (sketchy), Cartoonist (rough) |
| **Font family options** | Virgil (handwritten), Cascadia (code), system fonts |

### Post-Import Cleanup Wizard (v0.17.0)

A 10-step guided wizard that consolidates post-import data quality operations into a single, sequential workflow. After importing a GEDCOM file (especially one with data quality issues), users previously had to navigate multiple Control Center tabs and run operations in the correct order. The wizard provides a unified experience with progress tracking.

**Problem Solved:**

- **Scattered tools:** Cleanup operations were spread across Data Quality, Places, and other tabs
- **Unknown order:** No guidance on which operations to run first
- **Manual coordination:** Users had to remember to run each step and track what's done

**Wizard Steps:**

| Step | Operation | Type |
|------|-----------|------|
| 1 | Quality Report | Review-only |
| 2 | Fix Bidirectional Relationships | Batch-fix |
| 3 | Normalize Date Formats | Batch-fix |
| 4 | Normalize Gender Values | Batch-fix |
| 5 | Clear Orphan References | Batch-fix |
| 6 | Migrate Source Properties | Batch-fix |
| 7 | Standardize Place Variants | Interactive |
| 8 | Bulk Geocode | Interactive |
| 9 | Enrich Place Hierarchy | Interactive |
| 10 | Flatten Nested Properties | Batch-fix |

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Overview Grid** | 5×2 tile grid showing all 10 steps with status badges |
| **Progress Tracking** | Horizontal progress bar with step completion state |
| **Preview Mode** | Each batch step shows proposed changes before applying |
| **Session Persistence** | Wizard state saved to resume interrupted cleanup |
| **Smart Defaults** | Auto-skip steps with zero detected issues |
| **Summary Report** | Export completion stats to markdown |

**Entry Points:**
- Import Wizard results: "Run Cleanup Wizard" button
- Control Center > Data Quality > Quick Start card
- Command palette: "Canvas Roots: Post-Import Cleanup Wizard"

**Technical Notes:**
- `CleanupWizardModal` orchestrates the 10-step flow
- Reuses existing services: `DataQualityService`, `GeocodingService`, `PlaceGraphService`, `SourceMigrationService`
- State persisted in `plugin.settings.cleanupWizardState`

**Files Added:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/ui/modals/cleanup-wizard-modal.ts` | Main wizard modal with step navigation |
| `styles/cleanup-wizard.css` | Wizard-specific styling |

### Source Array Migration (v0.17.0)

Migration from indexed source properties (`source`, `source_2`, `source_3`) to a YAML array format (`sources: []`). This change improves scalability, simplifies Dataview queries, and aligns with modern frontmatter practices.

**Problem Solved:**

The indexed format had limitations:
- **Fixed slots:** Only 3 source slots available per entity
- **Query complexity:** Dataview queries had to check multiple properties
- **Schema rigidity:** Adding more sources required schema changes

**Format Change:**

```yaml
# Old format (no longer supported)
source: "[[Birth Certificate]]"
source_2: "[[Census 1920]]"
source_3: "[[Family Bible]]"

# New format (unlimited sources)
sources:
  - "[[Birth Certificate]]"
  - "[[Census 1920]]"
  - "[[Family Bible]]"
  - "[[Interview Notes]]"
```

**Migration Phases:**

| Phase | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Support both formats (read array, fall back to indexed) | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2 | Add migration tooling via Cleanup Wizard Step 6 | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 3 | Deprecate indexed format (console warnings) | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 4 | Remove indexed format support | ✅ Complete |

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Wizard Integration** | Step 6 of Cleanup Wizard handles migration |
| **Preview Mode** | Shows proposed changes before applying |
| **Batch Processing** | Migrates all notes in one operation |
| **Merge Support** | Combines indexed sources with existing array |
| **Legacy Warning** | Console warning for notes still using old format |

**Technical Notes:**
- `SourceMigrationService` handles detection and migration
- GEDCOM and Gramps importers now write array format by default
- Statistics service only reads `sources` array (indexed parsing removed)

**Files Added:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/sources/services/source-migration-service.ts` | Detection and migration logic |

**Breaking Change:** The indexed format (`source`, `source_2`, etc.) is no longer parsed. Users with legacy notes should run the Cleanup Wizard Step 6 to migrate.

See [Source Array Migration Planning](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/source-array-migration.md) for implementation details.

| `styles/migration-notice.css` | Notice styling |

---

## v0.16.x

### Import/Export Hub (v0.16.0)

Modal-based hub with step-by-step wizards for importing and exporting genealogical data, replacing the previous Import/Export tab in Control Center.

**Problem Solved:**

The previous import/export experience was fragmented:
- **Scattered UI:** Import/export lived in a Control Center tab, but progress displayed in separate modals
- **Disconnected numbering:** Post-import reference numbering was a separate modal, not integrated into the import workflow
- **Limited guidance:** No step-by-step flow for format selection, options, and preview

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hub Modal** | Two-card layout (Import, Export) matching Reports Hub and Media Manager patterns |
| **Import Wizard** | 7-step guided import with format selection, file picker, options, preview, progress, numbering, and completion |
| **Export Wizard** | 6-step guided export with format selection, folder picker, privacy controls, preview, progress, and completion |
| **Integrated Numbering** | Reference numbering (Ahnentafel, d'Aboville, Henry, Generation) built into import flow |
| **Privacy Controls** | Living person exclusion with redact vs. exclude options in export wizard |

**Import Wizard Steps:**

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 1. Format | Select GEDCOM 5.5.1, GEDCOM X (JSON), Gramps XML/.gpkg, or CSV |
| 2. File | Drag-and-drop file picker |
| 3. Options | Entity types, target folder, conflict handling, dynamic blocks toggle |
| 4. Preview | Entity counts, duplicate warnings |
| 5. Import | Progress with real-time log |
| 6. Numbering | Optional reference numbering with root person picker |
| 7. Complete | Summary with actions |

**Export Wizard Steps:**

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 1. Format | Select GEDCOM 5.5.1, GEDCOM X (JSON), Gramps XML, or CSV |
| 2. Folders | Preference folders or custom folder pickers |
| 3. Options | Privacy controls, inclusions (sources, places, notes, media) |
| 4. Preview | Entity counts, privacy summary |
| 5. Export | Progress with real-time log |
| 6. Complete | Download/save options |

**Technical Notes:**

- Reuses existing import/export logic (GEDCOM parsing, export generation)
- Integrates `ReferenceNumberingService` for numbering step
- `.gpkg` format includes embedded media, extracted and linked during import

**Files Added:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/ui/import-export-hub-modal.ts` | Hub modal with import/export cards |
| `src/ui/import-wizard-modal.ts` | 7-step import wizard |

## v0.15.x

### Visual Tree PDF Quality Improvements (v0.15.3)

Improved rendering quality for Visual Tree PDFs generated from the unified tree wizard, achieving parity with Family Chart PDF exports.

**Problem Solved:**
- Visual Tree PDFs generated via pdfmake appeared slightly blurry compared to Family Chart PDFs using jsPDF
- The pdfmake image embedding was resampling the tree image, causing quality loss
- No dynamic page sizing option for optimal digital viewing

**Changes:**

| Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **4× scale rendering** | Increased canvas scale from 2× to 4× in `visual-tree-svg-renderer.ts` |
| **Aspect ratio preservation** | Removed explicit height constraint from pdfmake image content |
| **Quality parity** | Visual Tree PDFs now match Family Chart PDF sharpness |

**Technical Details:**

The quality difference stemmed from how images are embedded in PDFs:

- **jsPDF (Family Chart):** Sizes the PDF page to match the content, avoiding any resampling
- **pdfmake (Visual Tree):** Used fixed page sizes with explicit width/height, causing resampling

The fix increases the source canvas resolution (4× instead of 2×) to compensate for any resampling, and removes the explicit height constraint to preserve aspect ratio.

**Files Changed:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/trees/services/visual-tree-svg-renderer.ts` | Changed scale from 2 to 4 |
| `src/reports/services/pdf-report-renderer.ts` | Removed height from image content |

See [Visual Tree PDF Enhancements Planning Document](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/visual-tree-pdf-enhancements.md) for technical analysis.

### Calendarium Integration Phase 2 (v0.15.2)

Display events with Calendarium `fc-*` date fields on Canvas Roots timelines, with calendar filtering support.

**Problem Solved:**
- Events using Calendarium's `fc-date` format weren't visible on Canvas Roots timelines
- No way to filter timeline views by calendar system when mixing real and fictional dates
- Timeline badges in People tab didn't show event counts

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **fc-date Parsing** | Read `fc-date` or `fc-start` as event start date |
| **fc-end Support** | Read `fc-end` as event end date for date ranges (lifespans, reigns) |

| **Female card** | Background color for female person cards |
| **Male card** | Background color for male person cards |
| **Unknown card** | Background color for unknown gender cards |
| **Background (light)** | Chart background in light theme |
| **Background (dark)** | Chart background in dark theme |
| **Text (light)** | Card text color in light theme |
| **Text (dark)** | Card text color in dark theme |

**Interaction with Style Settings:**

If you have the Style Settings plugin installed:
- In-view settings take precedence (applied via inline styles)
- "Reset to defaults" clears in-view settings, revealing Style Settings values
- Both can coexist—use in-view for quick switching, Style Settings for vault-wide defaults

**Files Changed:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/ui/views/family-chart-view.ts` | Palette button, theme presets, FamilyChartStyleModal |
| `src/settings.ts` | FamilyChartColors interface |
| `styles/family-chart-view.css` | Style modal CSS |

### Universal Media Linking (v0.15.0)

Extend the `media` property to all entity types (Person, Event, Place, Organization) with Gramps Package (`.gpkg`) import support and dynamic inline galleries.

**Problem Solved:**
- The `media` property was only supported on Source notes
- Gramps Package (`.gpkg`) import ignored bundled media files
- No way to display media galleries inline within person notes
- Writers and worldbuilders couldn't attach character portraits, location art, or scene illustrations

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Universal media property** | `media` supported on Person, Event, Place, Source, Organization notes |
| **Gramps Package import** | `.gpkg` files import with media extraction to vault |
| **Media linking during import** | Media files linked to all entity types based on Gramps `objref` references |
| **Dynamic media gallery** | `canvas-roots-media` code block renders inline gallery |
| **Editable mode** | Drag-to-reorder with `editable: true` option |
| **Freeze to callout** | Convert gallery to styled `[!info|cr-frozen-gallery]` callout |
| **Style Settings** | Gallery appearance customizable via Style Settings plugin |
| **Find Unlinked Media** | Tool to discover orphaned media files in vault |
| **Media folder filtering** | Settings to exclude folders from media searches |

**Dynamic Media Gallery:**

~~~markdown
```canvas-roots-media
columns: 3
size: medium
editable: false
title: Media
```
~~~

**Configuration options:**

| Option | Values | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `columns` | 2-6, `auto` | Number of columns in grid (default: 3) |
| `size` | `small`, `medium`, `large` | Thumbnail size (default: medium) |
| `editable` | `true`, `false` | Enable drag-to-reorder (default: false) |
| `title` | string | Custom header text (default: "Media") |

**Editable Mode:**

When `editable: true` is set:
- Items show a drag handle on hover
- Drag items to reorder their position
- First item becomes the thumbnail (shown on Family Chart nodes)
- Frontmatter is updated automatically when you drop
- Gallery has a dashed border to indicate edit mode

**Frozen Gallery:**

Click the freeze button (❄️) to convert to a styled callout:

~~~markdown
> [!info|cr-frozen-gallery]
> ![[portrait.jpg]]
> ![[wedding-photo.jpg]]
> ![[birth-certificate.pdf]]
~~~

The frozen gallery renders images in a flex layout with click-and-hold zoom.

**Entity Support:**

| Entity Type | Use Cases |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Person** | Photos, portraits, scanned documents, character concept art |
| **Event** | Ceremony photos, certificates, scene illustrations |
| **Place** | Location photos, historical maps, fantasy maps, floor plans |
| **Organization** | Logos, group photos, faction banners, heraldry |
| **Source** | Original records, digitized documents |

**Gramps Package Import:**

When importing a `.gpkg` file:
1. Media files are extracted to your configured media folder
2. `objref` elements in the Gramps XML are resolved to vault paths
3. `media` wikilinks are added to Person, Event, Place, and Source frontmatter
4. First media item serves as thumbnail (matching Gramps convention)

**Implementation Phases:**

| Phase | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Add `media` property to Person, Event, Place, Organization schemas |
| Phase 2 | Find Unlinked Media tool, Media Manager integration |
| Phase 3 | Media folder filtering and settings |

### Universe Management (v0.13.0)

First-class universe entity type for managing fictional worlds, with a dedicated Control Center tab, guided setup wizard, and comprehensive statistics integration.

**Problem Solved:**
- Worldbuilders had no central place to manage fictional universes (Middle-earth, Westeros, etc.)
- The `universe` field was a plain string with no validation, leading to typos creating duplicate "universes"
- No way to see which entities belonged to which universe
- No guided setup for creating a new world with calendar, map, and validation rules

**Universe Entity:**

Universe notes (`cr_type: universe`) serve as a canonical registry for fictional worlds:

```yaml
cr_type: universe
cr_id: middle-earth
name: Middle-earth
description: A fantasy world created by J.R.R. Tolkien
author: J.R.R. Tolkien
genre: fantasy
status: active
default_calendar: shire-reckoning
default_map: middle-earth-map
```

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Universe entity type** | First-class note type with full CRUD support |
| **UniverseService** | Entity aggregation, orphan detection, statistics |
| **Universes tab** | Dedicated Control Center tab (conditional visibility) |
| **Create Universe wizard** | Multi-step guided setup with optional calendar, map, and schema |
| **Statistics integration** | Universes section with entity counts and drill-down |
| **Guide tab documentation** | Universe notes section in Essential Properties card |
| **Context menu action** | "Add essential universe properties" for universe notes |
| **Universes base template** | 12 pre-configured views for browsing universes |

**Universes Tab:**

The Universes tab appears in Control Center when:
- Any universe notes exist in the vault, OR
- Any orphan universe strings exist (entities with `universe` field but no matching note)

This keeps the UI clean for genealogists who never use fictional worlds.

| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Actions** | Create universe (wizard), Create universes base |
| **Your universes** | List of universe notes with entity counts |
| **Orphan universe strings** | Entities referencing non-existent universes |

**Create Universe Wizard:**

| Step | Description | Skippable |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Universe details (name, description, author, genre, status) | No |
| 2 | Custom calendar? Creates linked date system | Yes |
| 3 | Custom map? Creates linked map configuration | Yes |
| 4 | Validation schema? Creates scoped schema | Yes |
| 5 | Summary with links to all created entities | No |

**Statistics Integration:**

The Statistics dashboard includes a Universes section showing:
- Universe count and list
- Per-universe entity breakdown (people, events, places, sources, organizations)
- Drill-down to view entities filtered by universe
- "View full statistics →" link to dashboard with universe filter

**Universes Base Template:**

12 pre-configured views for browsing universes:
- All Universes
- By Status (active, draft, archived)
- By Genre, By Author
- With/Without Calendars
- With/Without Maps
- Recently Created

**Context Menu:**

Right-click on a universe note to access:
- Add essential universe properties
- Open in Universes tab
- Create related entities (person, event, place, etc.) pre-populated with universe

**Backward Compatibility:**

- String-only `universe` values continue to function
- Orphan detection shows entities referencing non-existent universe notes
- New entities can link to universe notes via wikilink or use string values

See [Universe Management Planning Document](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/universe-management.md) for implementation details.

## v0.12.x

### Configurable Normalization (v0.12.12)

User-configurable sex value normalization modes that allow worldbuilders to protect custom sex values from GEDCOM-standard normalization.

**Problem Solved:**
- Worldbuilders using custom sex values (e.g., "hermaphrodite", "neuter" for alien species) had those values normalized to GEDCOM M/F when running "Normalize sex values"
- No way to skip normalization for notes covered by schemas with custom sex enum definitions
- All-or-nothing approach: either normalize everything or nothing

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Three normalization modes** | Standard (GEDCOM M/F), Schema-aware (skip protected notes), Disabled (never normalize) |
| **Schema-aware detection** | Checks if person has applicable schema with custom `sex` enum values |
| **Preview enhancement** | Shows which notes will be skipped due to schema override |
| **Preferences setting** | New dropdown in Preferences → Data Quality |

**Normalization Modes:**

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Standard** | Normalize all sex values to GEDCOM M/F (default, existing behavior) |
| **Schema-aware** | Skip notes covered by schemas that define custom sex enum values |
| **Disabled** | Never normalize sex values (preview shows what would change) |

**Schema-Aware Example:**

A worldbuilder creates a schema for their sci-fi universe:

```yaml
---
cr_type: schema
cr_id: schema-alien-species
applies_to_type: universe
applies_to_value: "Sci-Fi Universe"
---

```json schema
{
  "properties": {
    "sex": {
      "type": "enum",
      "values": ["male", "female", "neuter", "hermaphrodite"]
    }
  }
}
```

With **Schema-aware** mode enabled, person notes in the "Sci-Fi Universe" with sex values like "hermaphrodite" will be skipped during normalization, while notes in other universes (or without a universe) will still be normalized to GEDCOM M/F.

**Integration:**
- Builds on [Value Aliases](Release-History#value-aliases-v094) for synonym mapping
- Builds on [Schema Validation](Release-History#schema-validation-v063) for custom enum detection
- Uses existing Data Quality tab batch operation infrastructure

See [Sex/Gender Identity Expansion Planning Document](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/sex-gender-expansion.md) for Phase 4 implementation details.

### Step & Adoptive Parent Support (v0.12.10)

Comprehensive support for non-biological parent relationships, improving GEDCOM import fidelity and enabling accurate representation of blended families.

**Problem Solved:**
- GEDCOM files with step-parent or adoptive relationships (via `PEDI` tags) were imported as primary parent claims, triggering false conflicts
- No way to distinguish biological parents from step/adoptive parents in the data model
- Canvas trees could not visualize non-biological parent relationships

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **GEDCOM PEDI parsing** | Parse `PEDI` tags (`birth`, `step`, `adop`, `foster`) from GEDCOM 5.5.1 files |
| **Gramps mrel/frel parsing** | Parse `mrel`/`frel` attributes (`Birth`, `Stepchild`, `Adopted`) from Gramps XML |
| **GEDCOM X lineage types** | Parse lineage type facts (`StepParent`, `AdoptiveParent`, etc.) from GEDCOM X JSON |
| **Round-trip export** | Export step/adoptive parents with PEDI tags (GEDCOM), mrel/frel (Gramps), lineage facts (GEDCOM X) |
| **Dedicated frontmatter fields** | `stepfather_id`, `stepmother_id`, `adoptive_father_id`, `adoptive_mother_id` |
| **Conflict detection** | Step/adoptive parents excluded from biological parent conflicts |
| **Canvas visualization** | Step-parents shown with dashed lines, adoptive parents with dotted lines |
| **Tree generation toggles** | "Include step-parents" and "Include adoptive parents" options |
| **Create/Edit modal** | New section for manual entry of step/adoptive parents |
| **Statistics breakdown** | Parent type breakdown in Data Completeness, blended family metrics |

**New Frontmatter Fields:**

```yaml
# Biological parents (existing)
father_id: abc-123-def-456
mother_id: ghi-789-jkl-012

# Step-parents (can have multiple)
stepfather_id:
  - mno-345-pqr-678
  - abc-111-def-222
stepmother_id: stu-901-vwx-234

# Adoptive parents
adoptive_father_id: yza-567-bcd-890
adoptive_mother_id: efg-123-hij-456
```

**GEDCOM 5.5.1 Pedigree Types:**

| PEDI Value | Meaning | Canvas Roots Field |
|------------|---------|-------------------|
| `birth` | Biological | `father_id`, `mother_id` |
| `adop` | Adopted | `adoptive_father_id`, `adoptive_mother_id` |
| `step` | Step-child | `stepfather_id`, `stepmother_id` |
| `foster` | Foster child | (stored but not specially handled) |
| (absent) | Assumed biological | `father_id`, `mother_id` |

**Gramps XML Pedigree Types:**

| mrel/frel Value | Meaning | Canvas Roots Field |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| `Birth` | Biological | `father_id`, `mother_id` |
| `Adopted` | Adopted | `adoptive_father_id`, `adoptive_mother_id` |
| `Stepchild` | Step-child | `stepfather_id`, `stepmother_id` |
| `Foster` | Foster child | (stored but not specially handled) |
| (absent) | Assumed biological | `father_id`, `mother_id` |

**GEDCOM X Lineage Types:**

| Lineage Type | Meaning | Canvas Roots Field |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| `BiologicalParent` | Biological | `father_id`, `mother_id` |
| `AdoptiveParent` | Adopted | `adoptive_father_id`, `adoptive_mother_id` |
| `StepParent` | Step-parent | `stepfather_id`, `stepmother_id` |
| `FosterParent` | Foster parent | (stored but not specially handled) |
| `GuardianParent` | Guardian | (stored but not specially handled) |
| `SociologicalParent` | Sociological | (stored but not specially handled) |
| (absent) | Assumed biological | `father_id`, `mother_id` |

**New Relationship Types:**

| Type | Line Style | Color |

| `step_parent` / `step_child` | Dashed | Teal (#14b8a6) |
| `adoptive_parent` / `adopted_child` | Dotted | Cyan (#06b6d4) |

**Statistics Enhancements:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Parent type breakdown** | Counts of biological, step, and adoptive parents in Completeness section |
| **Biologically orphaned** | People with no biological parents but have step/adoptive |
| **Blended family count** | People with multiple parent types |

**Tree Behavior:**
- Ancestor trees: Step/adoptive parents included as leaf nodes (no ancestry recursion)
- Full trees: Step/adoptive parents included by default, follow their connections
- Both respect the include toggles in tree generation UI

See [Step & Adoptive Parent Support Planning Document](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/step-adoptive-parent-support.md) for implementation details.

- Fixed Family Chart opening in sidebar instead of main workspace

---

### Gramps Source Import (v0.12.6)

Import source and citation records from Gramps XML files, creating Canvas Roots source notes with full metadata and linking citations to person/event notes.

**Problem Solved:**
- Gramps XML import supported people, places, and events, but source/citation records were not imported
- Users migrating from Gramps had to manually recreate source documentation
- Repository metadata and media references were lost during migration

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Source note creation** | One note per Gramps source record with full metadata |
| **Repository support** | Parse `<repositories>` and `<reporef>` elements for archive/library data |
| **Media references** | Store Gramps media handles in `gramps_media_refs` for manual linking |
| **Source property aliases** | Full property alias support for all 15 source properties |
| **Gramps ID preservation** | Store `gramps_handle` and `gramps_id` for re-import scenarios |
| **Progress indicator** | Real-time progress modal during import |
| **UI toggles** | Obsidian-style toggles for import options |

**Field Mapping:**

| Gramps Field | Canvas Roots Property |

| `<sauthor>` | `author` |
| `<spubinfo>` | `repository` (fallback) |
| Repository `<rname>` | `repository` |
| Repository `<type>` | `repository_type` |
| `<reporef medium>` | `source_medium` |
| `<noteref>` text | Note body content |
| `<objref>` handles | `gramps_media_refs` |

**Confidence Scale Mapping:**

| Gramps (0-4) | Meaning | Canvas Roots |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| 0 | Very Low | low |
| 1 | Low | low |
| 2 | Normal | medium |
| 3 | High | high |
| 4 | Very High | high |

**Source Property Aliases:**

All 15 source properties support aliasing via Preferences → Property aliases:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `cr_id` | Unique identifier |
| `cr_type` | Note type (source) |
| `title` | Source title |
| `author` | Author/creator |
| `source_type` | Type (census, vital_record, etc.) |
| `repository` | Archive or website |
| `repository_type` | Library, Archive, etc. |
| `source_medium` | Book, Electronic, etc. |
| `confidence` | High/medium/low |

### Bulk Source-Image Linking (v0.12.5)

Two wizard tools for managing source images: importing new images as source notes, and linking existing images to existing source notes.

**Problem Solved:**
- Genealogists often have hundreds of source images (census records, vital records, photos) with inconsistent naming conventions
- Manual creation of source notes from images is tedious
- Existing source notes without media require manual attachment of related images
- No way to bulk-process images with intelligent metadata extraction

**Features:**

**Source Image Import Wizard** (`Sources tab → Import`):

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Folder selection** | Browse vault folders containing source images |
| **Filename parsing** | Extract surnames, years, record types, locations from filenames |
| **Confidence indicators** | Visual dots (green/yellow/orange/gray) showing parse quality |
| **Editable metadata** | Review and correct parsed data before import |
| **Source note creation** | Creates source notes with media wikilinks in frontmatter |

**Source Media Linker Wizard** (`Sources tab → Link`):

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Target sources** | Only shows source notes without existing media |
| **Smart suggestions** | Scores potential matches based on filename analysis |
| **Auto-selection** | Top suggestion pre-selected with confidence indicator |
| **"+N more" badge** | Shows when alternative suggestions exist |
| **Row highlighting** | Yellow background for rows needing manual selection |
| **Summary breakdown** | Shows auto-matched vs. manual selection counts |

**Filename Parser:**

Extracts metadata from common genealogy image naming patterns:

| Pattern | Extracted Data |
|---------|----------------|
| `smith_census_1900.jpg` | Surname: Smith, Type: census, Year: 1900 |
| `Marriage Cert Boston 1875.jpeg` | Type: marriage, Location: Boston, Year: 1875 |
| `henderson_obituary_1945.jpg` | Surname: Henderson, Type: obituary, Year: 1945 |

**Confidence Scoring:**

| Score Range | Confidence | Visual |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| ≥50 | High | 🟢 Green dot |
| 30-49 | Medium | 🟡 Yellow dot |
| 1-29 | Low | 🟠 Orange dot |
| 0 | None | ⚪ Gray dot |

**Technical Details:**
- `ImageFilenameParser` service handles filename analysis
- Source matching uses scoring algorithm based on surname, year, type, and location overlap
- Media stored as wikilinks in source frontmatter (`media`, `media_2`, etc.)
- Builds on existing `SourceService` for note creation and updates

---

### Calendarium Integration Phase 1 (v0.12.0)

Integration with the [Calendarium](https://github.com/javalent/calendarium) plugin to import calendar definitions for fictional dates.

**Problem Solved:**
- Worldbuilders using Calendarium for fantasy calendar management had to manually recreate calendar definitions in Canvas Roots
- No way to leverage existing Calendarium calendar structure (eras, year directions)

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Calendar import** | Automatically import Calendarium calendars as Canvas Roots date systems |
| **Era preservation** | Era names, abbreviations, and year directions are preserved |
| **Zero configuration** | Calendars appear automatically when integration is enabled |
| **Invisible when not needed** | Integrations card only appears if Calendarium is installed |

**How It Works:**

1. Install [Calendarium](https://github.com/javalent/calendarium) plugin
2. Open Control Center → Preferences → Integrations
3. Set Integration mode to "Read-only (import calendars)"
4. Calendarium calendars appear in Date Systems card and Create Event modal

**Technical Details:**

- Uses `window.Calendarium` global API
- Waits for Calendarium settings to load before importing
- Converts Calendarium eras to Canvas Roots `FictionalEra` format
- Handles starting eras (epoch 0) and regular eras with dates
- Extracts era abbreviations from Calendarium format strings

**Settings:**

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `calendariumIntegration` | `off`, `read` | `off` |

**Future Phases:**
- Phase 2: Display Calendarium events on timelines
- Phase 3: Bidirectional sync between plugins
- Phase 4: Cross-calendar date translation

See [Fictional Date Systems - Calendarium Integration](Fictional-Date-Systems#calendarium-integration) and [Roadmap - Calendarium Integration](Roadmap#calendarium-integration) for details.

## v0.11.x

### Export v2 (v0.11.0)

Complete overhaul of export functionality with full entity support and round-trip fidelity with GEDCOM Import v2.

See [export-v2.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/export-v2.md) for implementation plan.

**Problem Solved:**
- Previous exports only included people (person notes)
- Events, sources, places, and custom relationships were lost on export
- No round-trip fidelity with GEDCOM Import v2 (import created entity notes, but export discarded them)
- Limited export options and no real-time statistics

**Full Entity Export:**

All four export formats (GEDCOM 5.5.1, GEDCOM X, Gramps XML, CSV) now support:

| Entity Type | Export Support |
|-------------|----------------|
| **People** | Full person records with all properties |
| **Events** | All 22 event types with dates, places, participants, sources, confidence levels |
| **Sources** | Source notes with citations, repositories, quality classification |
| **Places** | Place hierarchy, coordinates, categories, types preserved |
| **Custom Relationships** | Godparent, guardian, mentor, etc. (GEDCOM: ASSO records; other formats: dedicated fields) |

**Enhanced Export UI:**

- **Export statistics preview**: Real-time count of entities before export
  - Shows people count, event count, source count, place count
  - Respects collection filters and branch filters
  - Updates dynamically as options change
- **Entity inclusion toggles**: Granular control over what to include
  - Toggle people, events, sources, places individually
  - Statistics update to reflect selections
- **Format-specific options**:
  - GEDCOM: Version selector (5.5.1 vs 7.0), collection codes toggle, custom relationships toggle
  - All formats: Entity toggles, output location, privacy settings
- **Output location options**:
  - Download file (traditional behavior)
  - Save to vault (specify folder path)
- **Export progress modal**: Full-screen modal showing:
  - Current phase (loading, filtering, privacy, events, sources, places, generating, writing)
  - Progress bar with percentage
  - Running statistics (entities processed so far)
  - Phase-specific icons and labels
- **Last export info**: Display previous export timestamp, entity counts, destination

**Property & Value Alias Integration:**

All exporters now respect user-configured property and value aliases:

- **Property aliases**: Export using canonical property names (e.g., `born` → `BIRT` in GEDCOM)
- **Value aliases**: Map custom event types, sex values, place categories to canonical values before export
- **Gender identity field**: New `gender_identity` property exported appropriately for each format
  - GEDCOM: Custom `_GEND` tag
  - GEDCOM X: `gender` field
  - Gramps XML: Custom attribute
  - CSV: Dedicated column

**Custom Relationships Export:**

GEDCOM 5.5.1 now exports custom relationships as ASSO records:

```gedcom
1 ASSO @I2@
2 RELA godparent
2 NOTE Relationship from 1920-05-15 to 1935-08-20
2 NOTE Became godparent at baptism
```

- Includes relationship type name as RELA descriptor
- Date ranges in NOTE subrecords
- Custom notes preserved
- Only defined relationships exported (not inferred bidirectional ones)
- Toggle option in export settings (enabled by default)

**Round-Trip Fidelity:**

Exports now preserve all data from GEDCOM Import v2:

| Import Creates | Export Preserves |
|----------------|------------------|
| Event notes | All event types, dates, places, participants, sources |
| Source notes | Citations, repositories, confidence levels, media links |
| Place notes | Hierarchy, coordinates, categories, historical names |
| Custom relationships | ASSO records with full metadata |

**Before Export v2:**
```
Import GEDCOM → 500 people, 350 events, 200 sources, 150 places
Export GEDCOM → 500 people only (850 entities lost)
```

**After Export v2:**
```
Import GEDCOM → 500 people, 350 events, 200 sources, 150 places
Export GEDCOM → 500 people, 350 events, 200 sources, 150 places (full fidelity)
```

**Architecture:**

- **Shared ExportOptionsBuilder**: Consolidated UI component used across all export formats
- **Service injection pattern**: Exporters conditionally load EventService, SourceService, PlaceGraphService, RelationshipService
- **Progress callback system**: Unified progress reporting for all export phases
- **ExportStatisticsService**: Calculates real-time entity counts based on current filter settings

## v0.10.x

### Sex/Gender Identity Fields (v0.10.20)

Separate `gender_identity` field for inclusive handling of sex and gender, with full export support across all formats.

See [sex-gender-expansion.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/sex-gender-expansion.md) for implementation plan (Phases 1-3).

**Problem Solved:**
- The `sex` field follows GEDCOM standards (M/F) for historical record compatibility, but doesn't capture gender identity
- Writers and worldbuilders need separate fields for biological sex vs. gender identity
- LGBTQ+ genealogists researching trans individuals need respectful data handling

**Features:**

**Gender Identity Field (Phase 1):**
- New optional `gender_identity` property on person notes
- Separate from biological `sex` field for historical record accuracy
- Displayed in People tab person details
- Included in all export formats:
  - GEDCOM: Custom `_GEND` tag
  - GEDCOM X: `gender` field
  - Gramps XML: Custom attribute
  - CSV: Dedicated column

**Schema-Based Definitions (Phase 2):**
- Schema system supports custom sex/gender values via `enum` types
- Scoped by collection or universe for worldbuilding
- Example: `sex` values of ["male", "female", "neuter", "hermaphrodite", "asexual"] for alien species

**Value Aliases (Phase 3):**
- Sex field supports 4 canonical values: male, female, nonbinary, unknown
- Built-in synonyms (M → male, F → female)
- Custom aliases configurable via Unified Property Configuration UI
- All exporters respect value aliases

**User Personas:**
- **Genealogist:** Uses `sex` field with GEDCOM M/F values; optionally `gender_identity` for living relatives or LGBTQ+ research
- **Fiction writer / Worldbuilder:** Custom sex values via Schema, separate `gender_identity` field for character development

**Respectful Trans Documentation:**
When documenting trans individuals:
- `name` field holds chosen/current name (displayed by default)
- Optional `birth_name` field for birth records if needed for research
- `gender_identity` captures current identity
- `sex` captures what appears on historical records
- Privacy options can exclude `birth_name` and `sex` from exports

---

### Unified Property Configuration (v0.10.19)

Consolidated property and value alias management in a single interface with comprehensive coverage of all canonical properties.

See [unified-property-config.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/unified-property-config.md) for implementation plan.

**Problem Solved:**
- Property aliases were managed through modal-based workflows with limited discoverability
- Users couldn't see which properties supported aliasing without trial and error
- Value aliases were separate from property aliases with inconsistent UI
- No search/filter to find specific properties across ~55 canonical properties

**Features:**

**Property Aliases:**
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All 56 canonical properties across Person (28), Event (20), and Place (8) entity types
- **Collapsible sections**: Properties grouped by entity type (all collapsed by default)
- **Lazy rendering**: Section content only renders when first expanded for performance
- **Search/filter**: Find properties by label, description, canonical name, or common aliases
- **Inline editing**: Configure aliases directly with auto-save on blur
- **Validation**: Checks for empty values, self-aliasing, conflicts with other properties/aliases

**Value Aliases:**
- **Unified interface**: Value aliases styled consistently with property aliases
- **Four value types**: Event type (13 values), Sex (4 values), Place category (6 values), Note type (8 values)
- **Alias count badges**: Section headers show how many aliases are configured per field
- **Inline editing**: Configure value mappings with validation on blur
- **Canonical value labels**: Human-readable display of canonical values

**UI Improvements:**
- Native Obsidian Setting components for consistent look and feel
- Validation on blur (not on keystroke) to avoid blocking partial input
- All sections use HTML `<details>` elements for native collapsibility
- Search box with real-time filtering across all properties

**Property Coverage:**

| Entity Type | Properties | Examples |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| Person | 28 | name, born, died, cr_id, sex, gender_identity, father, mother, spouse, children, birth_place, death_place, occupation, nickname, maiden_name |
| Event | 20 | title, event_type, date, date_precision, place, person, participants, groups, sources, confidence |
| Place | 8 | name, full_name, parent_place, latitude, longitude, place_type, place_category, historical_name |

**Value Coverage:**

| Field | Canonical Values | Examples |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| Event type | 13 | birth, death, marriage, burial, residence, occupation, education, military, immigration, baptism, confirmation, ordination, custom |
| Sex | 4 | male, female, nonbinary, unknown |
| Place category | 6 | real, historical, disputed, legendary, mythological, fictional |
| Note type | 8 | person, place, event, source, organization, map, schema, timeline |

### Data Enhancement Pass (v0.10.17)

Commands and UI tools to upgrade existing vaults by creating missing linked entities from existing person note data. Designed for users who imported GEDCOM before Canvas Roots supported event, place, or source note types.

See [data-enhancement-pass.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/data-enhancement-pass.md) for implementation plan.

**Use Cases:**
- Imported GEDCOM before v0.10.0: No event notes were created; birth/death dates are flat properties
- Imported GEDCOM before v0.9.0: No source notes; source citations were ignored
- Have place strings instead of wikilinks: `birthPlace: "Dublin, Ireland"` instead of `birthPlace: "[[Dublin, Ireland]]"`
- Want event notes for existing data: Retroactively create event notes to use timeline features

**Generate Place Notes (v0.10.17):**
- Scans person notes for `birth_place`, `death_place` properties
- Scans event notes for `place` properties
- Detects string values (not wikilinks) that need conversion
- Creates place notes with proper hierarchy (parents created first)
- Updates references to use wikilinks
- Preview mode shows what will be created/modified
- Matches existing place notes to avoid duplicates
- Progress indicator during bulk generation with cancel support
- Paginated results table with search/sort after completion
- Edit button on each result to open Edit Place modal

**Planned Features:**
- Generate Events from Dates: Create event notes from person `birthDate`/`deathDate` properties
- Re-parse GEDCOM for Sources: Re-import GEDCOM to extract sources, matching to existing person notes

---

### Type Customization (v0.10.3)

Full type manager for each note category: events, sources, organizations, relationships, and places. Create, edit, hide, and customize types and categories with user-defined names.

**Type Managers:**

Each Control Center tab now includes a "Manage types" card:

| Tab | Types | Features |
|-----|-------|----------|
| Events | 22 built-in event types | Custom types, categories (Core, Extended, Narrative), icon/color |
| Sources | 6 built-in source types | Custom types, categories, description |
| Organizations | 11 built-in org types | Custom types, categories |
| Relationships | 17 built-in relationship types | Custom types, color, line style (solid, dashed, dotted) |
| Places | 16 built-in place types | Custom types, categories, hierarchy level (0-99) |

**Type Management Features:**
- **Create custom types**: Add new types with full customization
- **Override built-in types**: Change name, description, icon, color
- **Hide types**: Remove from dropdowns while preserving existing notes
- **Reset to defaults**: Restore customized built-in types
- **Delete custom types**: Remove user-created types entirely

**Category Management:**
- Create custom categories to group related types
- Rename built-in categories to match your terminology
- Reorder categories with sort order field
- Hide unused categories (built-in or custom)
- "Show all" button to restore hidden categories

**Place Type Specifics:**
- Hierarchy levels (0-99) determine valid parent-child relationships
- Categories (geographic, political, settlement, subdivision, structure) organize the UI
- Users can assign place types to any category regardless of hierarchy
- Quick level presets for common hierarchy positions

**Settings Storage:**
```typescript
// Per-category settings (events shown as example)
customEventTypes: EventTypeDefinition[];
eventTypeCustomizations: Record<string, Partial<EventTypeDefinition>>;
hiddenEventTypes: string[];
customEventCategories: EventCategoryDefinition[];
categoryCustomizations: Record<string, Partial<EventCategoryDefinition>>;
hiddenCategories: string[];
```

**Use Cases:**
- Rename "birth" to "nameday" for fantasy world-building
- Add "coronation" and "succession" event types for dynasty tracking
- Create "Land Records" source type for property research
- Hide unused relationship types like "apprentice" or "mentor"
- Add "Bodies of Water" category for place types

---

### Flexible Note Type Detection (v0.10.2)

Support multiple methods for identifying Canvas Roots note types, avoiding conflicts with other plugins that use the `type` property.

**Problem Solved:**
- The generic `type` property conflicts with other plugins (Templater, Dataview, etc.)
- Some users prefer tags (`#person`) over frontmatter properties
- Need a namespaced property to avoid conflicts

**New Standard: `cr_type`**

New installations now use `cr_type` as the primary type property:
```yaml
cr_type: person
```

This aligns with the existing `cr_id` convention and avoids conflicts with other plugins.

**Detection Methods (checked in order):**
1. **`cr_type` property** - New default, namespaced to avoid conflicts (e.g., `cr_type: person`)
2. **`type` property** - Legacy fallback for existing vaults (e.g., `type: person`)
3. **Tags** - Additional fallback via tags (`#person`, `#place`, `#event`, `#source`, `#map`, `#organization`)
   - Supports nested tags (e.g., `#genealogy/person`)

**Settings:**
- **Primary type property**: Choose between `cr_type` (default) or `type` (legacy)
- **Enable tag-based detection**: Toggle tags as fallback detection method

**Supported Note Types:**
- `person` - Person notes with family relationships
- `place` - Place notes with geographic data
- `event` - Event notes for chronological mapping
- `source` - Source notes for evidence management
- `map` - Custom map configuration notes
- `organization` - Organization notes for hierarchies
- `schema` - Schema validation notes
- `proof_summary` - GPS proof summary notes

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- Existing users automatically keep `type` as their primary (migrated on first load)
- Both properties are always checked (primary first, then fallback)
- Person notes with `cr_id` but no explicit type are still detected as persons
- No migration of existing notes required

---

### GEDCOM Import v2 (v0.10.1)

Enhanced GEDCOM import that creates source notes, event notes, and place notes in addition to person notes.

**Import Options UI:**
- Toggle for each note type: people, events, sources, places
- Filename format selection: Original (John Smith.md), Kebab-case (john-smith.md), Snake_case (john_smith.md)
- Per-type filename formats via "Customize per note type" toggle
- Progress modal showing import phases with running statistics
- File analysis with counts before confirming import

**Source Import:**
- Parse `SOUR` records and `@S1@`-style source references
- Create source notes (`cr_type: source`) with available metadata
- Support for `TITL`, `AUTH`, `PUBL`, `REPO` fields

**Event Import:**
- Create event notes (`cr_type: event`) for all supported GEDCOM tags:
  - **Core (4):** `BIRT`, `DEAT`, `MARR`, `DIV`
  - **Life Events (6):** `BURI`, `CREM`, `ADOP`, `GRAD`, `RETI`, `CENS`
  - **Career/Residence (3):** `RESI`, `OCCU`, `EDUC`
  - **Legal/Estate (4):** `PROB`, `WILL`, `NATU`, `MILI`
  - **Migration (2):** `IMMI`, `EMIG`
  - **Religious (8):** `BAPM`, `CHR`, `CHRA`, `CONF`, `FCOM`, `ORDN`, `BARM`, `BASM`, `BLES`
  - **Family (7):** `ENGA`, `MARB`, `MARC`, `MARL`, `MARS`, `ANUL`, `DIVF`
- Preserve date precision from GEDCOM (`ABT`, `BEF`, `AFT`, `BET`)

**Person Attributes (stored as properties):**
- `DSCR` → `physicalDescription`
- `IDNO` → `identityNumber` (sensitive - redacted from exports)
- `NATI` → `nationality`
- `RELI` → `religion`
- `TITL` → `title`
- `PROP` → `property`
- `CAST` → `caste`
- `NCHI` → `childrenCount`
- `NMR` → `marriageCount`
- `SSN` → `ssn` (sensitive - redacted from exports)

**Place Import:**
- Hierarchical place structure parsing (`City, County, State, Country`)
- Create place notes (`type: place`) with parent/child relationships
- Duplicate detection: case-insensitive matching on `full_name` property

- Update existing places (add missing parent links) instead of creating duplicates

**Performance:**
- Optimized connected components analysis (O(n+m) instead of O(n×m))
- Paginated People tab (100 at a time) for large imports
- Progress callback throughout all import phases

**Integration Points:**
- Staging folder support (import to staging, review, then merge)
- Property aliases (use configured property names)
- Value aliases (map GEDCOM event types to Canvas Roots types)
