## v0.12.x

### Bulk Source-Image Linking (v0.12.5)

Two wizard tools for managing source images: importing new images as source notes, and linking existing images to existing source notes.

**Problem Solved:**
- Genealogists often have hundreds of source images (census records, vital records, photos) with inconsistent naming conventions
- Manual creation of source notes from images is tedious
- Existing source notes without media require manual attachment of related images
- No way to bulk-process images with intelligent metadata extraction

**Features:**

**Source Image Import Wizard** (`Sources tab → Import`):

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Folder selection** | Browse vault folders containing source images |
| **Filename parsing** | Extract surnames, years, record types, locations from filenames |
| **Confidence indicators** | Visual dots (green/yellow/orange/gray) showing parse quality |
| **Editable metadata** | Review and correct parsed data before import |
| **Source note creation** | Creates source notes with media wikilinks in frontmatter |

**Source Media Linker Wizard** (`Sources tab → Link`):

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Target sources** | Only shows source notes without existing media |
| **Smart suggestions** | Scores potential matches based on filename analysis |
| **Auto-selection** | Top suggestion pre-selected with confidence indicator |
| **"+N more" badge** | Shows when alternative suggestions exist |
| **Row highlighting** | Yellow background for rows needing manual selection |
| **Summary breakdown** | Shows auto-matched vs. manual selection counts |

**Filename Parser:**

Extracts metadata from common genealogy image naming patterns:

| Pattern | Extracted Data |
|---------|----------------|
| `smith_census_1900.jpg` | Surname: Smith, Type: census, Year: 1900 |
| `Marriage Cert Boston 1875.jpeg` | Type: marriage, Location: Boston, Year: 1875 |
| `henderson_obituary_1945.jpg` | Surname: Henderson, Type: obituary, Year: 1945 |

**Confidence Scoring:**

| Score Range | Confidence | Visual |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| ≥50 | High | 🟢 Green dot |
| 30-49 | Medium | 🟡 Yellow dot |
| 1-29 | Low | 🟠 Orange dot |
| 0 | None | ⚪ Gray dot |

**Technical Details:**
- `ImageFilenameParser` service handles filename analysis
- Source matching uses scoring algorithm based on surname, year, type, and location overlap
- Media stored as wikilinks in source frontmatter (`media`, `media_2`, etc.)
- Builds on existing `SourceService` for note creation and updates

---

### Calendarium Integration Phase 1 (v0.12.0)

Integration with the [Calendarium](https://github.com/javalent/calendarium) plugin to import calendar definitions for fictional dates.

**Problem Solved:**
- Worldbuilders using Calendarium for fantasy calendar management had to manually recreate calendar definitions in Canvas Roots
- No way to leverage existing Calendarium calendar structure (eras, year directions)

**Features:**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Calendar import** | Automatically import Calendarium calendars as Canvas Roots date systems |
| **Era preservation** | Era names, abbreviations, and year directions are preserved |
| **Zero configuration** | Calendars appear automatically when integration is enabled |
| **Invisible when not needed** | Integrations card only appears if Calendarium is installed |

**How It Works:**

1. Install [Calendarium](https://github.com/javalent/calendarium) plugin
2. Open Control Center → Preferences → Integrations
3. Set Integration mode to "Read-only (import calendars)"
4. Calendarium calendars appear in Date Systems card and Create Event modal

**Technical Details:**

- Uses `window.Calendarium` global API
- Waits for Calendarium settings to load before importing
- Converts Calendarium eras to Canvas Roots `FictionalEra` format
- Handles starting eras (epoch 0) and regular eras with dates
- Extracts era abbreviations from Calendarium format strings

**Settings:**

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `calendariumIntegration` | `off`, `read` | `off` |

**Future Phases:**
- Phase 2: Display Calendarium events on timelines
- Phase 3: Bidirectional sync between plugins
- Phase 4: Cross-calendar date translation

See [Fictional Date Systems - Calendarium Integration](Fictional-Date-Systems#calendarium-integration) and [Roadmap - Calendarium Integration](Roadmap#calendarium-integration) for details.

## v0.11.x

### Export v2 (v0.11.0)

Complete overhaul of export functionality with full entity support and round-trip fidelity with GEDCOM Import v2.

See [export-v2.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/export-v2.md) for implementation plan.

**Problem Solved:**
- Previous exports only included people (person notes)
- Events, sources, places, and custom relationships were lost on export
- No round-trip fidelity with GEDCOM Import v2 (import created entity notes, but export discarded them)
- Limited export options and no real-time statistics

**Full Entity Export:**

All four export formats (GEDCOM 5.5.1, GEDCOM X, Gramps XML, CSV) now support:

| Entity Type | Export Support |
|-------------|----------------|
| **People** | Full person records with all properties |
| **Events** | All 22 event types with dates, places, participants, sources, confidence levels |
| **Sources** | Source notes with citations, repositories, quality classification |
| **Places** | Place hierarchy, coordinates, categories, types preserved |
| **Custom Relationships** | Godparent, guardian, mentor, etc. (GEDCOM: ASSO records; other formats: dedicated fields) |

**Enhanced Export UI:**

- **Export statistics preview**: Real-time count of entities before export
  - Shows people count, event count, source count, place count
  - Respects collection filters and branch filters
  - Updates dynamically as options change
- **Entity inclusion toggles**: Granular control over what to include
  - Toggle people, events, sources, places individually
  - Statistics update to reflect selections
- **Format-specific options**:
  - GEDCOM: Version selector (5.5.1 vs 7.0), collection codes toggle, custom relationships toggle
  - All formats: Entity toggles, output location, privacy settings
- **Output location options**:
  - Download file (traditional behavior)
  - Save to vault (specify folder path)
- **Export progress modal**: Full-screen modal showing:
  - Current phase (loading, filtering, privacy, events, sources, places, generating, writing)
  - Progress bar with percentage
  - Running statistics (entities processed so far)
  - Phase-specific icons and labels
- **Last export info**: Display previous export timestamp, entity counts, destination

**Property & Value Alias Integration:**

All exporters now respect user-configured property and value aliases:

- **Property aliases**: Export using canonical property names (e.g., `born` → `BIRT` in GEDCOM)
- **Value aliases**: Map custom event types, sex values, place categories to canonical values before export
- **Gender identity field**: New `gender_identity` property exported appropriately for each format
  - GEDCOM: Custom `_GEND` tag
  - GEDCOM X: `gender` field
  - Gramps XML: Custom attribute
  - CSV: Dedicated column

**Custom Relationships Export:**

GEDCOM 5.5.1 now exports custom relationships as ASSO records:

```gedcom
1 ASSO @I2@
2 RELA godparent
2 NOTE Relationship from 1920-05-15 to 1935-08-20
2 NOTE Became godparent at baptism
```

- Includes relationship type name as RELA descriptor
- Date ranges in NOTE subrecords
- Custom notes preserved
- Only defined relationships exported (not inferred bidirectional ones)
- Toggle option in export settings (enabled by default)

**Round-Trip Fidelity:**

Exports now preserve all data from GEDCOM Import v2:

| Import Creates | Export Preserves |
|----------------|------------------|
| Event notes | All event types, dates, places, participants, sources |
| Source notes | Citations, repositories, confidence levels, media links |
| Place notes | Hierarchy, coordinates, categories, historical names |
| Custom relationships | ASSO records with full metadata |

**Before Export v2:**
```
Import GEDCOM → 500 people, 350 events, 200 sources, 150 places
Export GEDCOM → 500 people only (850 entities lost)
```

**After Export v2:**
```
Import GEDCOM → 500 people, 350 events, 200 sources, 150 places
Export GEDCOM → 500 people, 350 events, 200 sources, 150 places (full fidelity)
```

**Architecture:**

- **Shared ExportOptionsBuilder**: Consolidated UI component used across all export formats
- **Service injection pattern**: Exporters conditionally load EventService, SourceService, PlaceGraphService, RelationshipService
- **Progress callback system**: Unified progress reporting for all export phases
- **ExportStatisticsService**: Calculates real-time entity counts based on current filter settings

---

## v0.10.x

### Sex/Gender Identity Fields (v0.10.20)

Separate `gender_identity` field for inclusive handling of sex and gender, with full export support across all formats.

See [sex-gender-expansion.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/sex-gender-expansion.md) for implementation plan (Phases 1-3).

**Problem Solved:**
- The `sex` field follows GEDCOM standards (M/F) for historical record compatibility, but doesn't capture gender identity
- Writers and worldbuilders need separate fields for biological sex vs. gender identity
- LGBTQ+ genealogists researching trans individuals need respectful data handling

**Features:**

**Gender Identity Field (Phase 1):**
- New optional `gender_identity` property on person notes
- Separate from biological `sex` field for historical record accuracy
- Displayed in People tab person details
- Included in all export formats:
  - GEDCOM: Custom `_GEND` tag
  - GEDCOM X: `gender` field
  - Gramps XML: Custom attribute
  - CSV: Dedicated column

**Schema-Based Definitions (Phase 2):**
- Schema system supports custom sex/gender values via `enum` types
- Scoped by collection or universe for worldbuilding
- Example: `sex` values of ["male", "female", "neuter", "hermaphrodite", "asexual"] for alien species

**Value Aliases (Phase 3):**
- Sex field supports 4 canonical values: male, female, nonbinary, unknown
- Built-in synonyms (M → male, F → female)
- Custom aliases configurable via Unified Property Configuration UI
- All exporters respect value aliases

**User Personas:**
- **Genealogist:** Uses `sex` field with GEDCOM M/F values; optionally `gender_identity` for living relatives or LGBTQ+ research
- **Fiction writer / Worldbuilder:** Custom sex values via Schema, separate `gender_identity` field for character development

**Respectful Trans Documentation:**
When documenting trans individuals:
- `name` field holds chosen/current name (displayed by default)
- Optional `birth_name` field for birth records if needed for research
- `gender_identity` captures current identity
- `sex` captures what appears on historical records
- Privacy options can exclude `birth_name` and `sex` from exports

---

### Unified Property Configuration (v0.10.19)

Consolidated property and value alias management in a single interface with comprehensive coverage of all canonical properties.

See [unified-property-config.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/unified-property-config.md) for implementation plan.

**Problem Solved:**
- Property aliases were managed through modal-based workflows with limited discoverability
- Users couldn't see which properties supported aliasing without trial and error
- Value aliases were separate from property aliases with inconsistent UI
- No search/filter to find specific properties across ~55 canonical properties

**Features:**

**Property Aliases:**
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All 56 canonical properties across Person (28), Event (20), and Place (8) entity types
- **Collapsible sections**: Properties grouped by entity type (all collapsed by default)
- **Lazy rendering**: Section content only renders when first expanded for performance
- **Search/filter**: Find properties by label, description, canonical name, or common aliases
- **Inline editing**: Configure aliases directly with auto-save on blur
- **Validation**: Checks for empty values, self-aliasing, conflicts with other properties/aliases

**Value Aliases:**
- **Unified interface**: Value aliases styled consistently with property aliases
- **Four value types**: Event type (13 values), Sex (4 values), Place category (6 values), Note type (8 values)
- **Alias count badges**: Section headers show how many aliases are configured per field
- **Inline editing**: Configure value mappings with validation on blur
- **Canonical value labels**: Human-readable display of canonical values

**UI Improvements:**
- Native Obsidian Setting components for consistent look and feel
- Validation on blur (not on keystroke) to avoid blocking partial input
- All sections use HTML `<details>` elements for native collapsibility
- Search box with real-time filtering across all properties

**Property Coverage:**

| Entity Type | Properties | Examples |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| Person | 28 | name, born, died, cr_id, sex, gender_identity, father, mother, spouse, children, birth_place, death_place, occupation, nickname, maiden_name |
| Event | 20 | title, event_type, date, date_precision, place, person, participants, groups, sources, confidence |
| Place | 8 | name, full_name, parent_place, latitude, longitude, place_type, place_category, historical_name |

**Value Coverage:**

| Field | Canonical Values | Examples |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| Event type | 13 | birth, death, marriage, burial, residence, occupation, education, military, immigration, baptism, confirmation, ordination, custom |
| Sex | 4 | male, female, nonbinary, unknown |
| Place category | 6 | real, historical, disputed, legendary, mythological, fictional |
| Note type | 8 | person, place, event, source, organization, map, schema, timeline |

### Data Enhancement Pass (v0.10.17)

Commands and UI tools to upgrade existing vaults by creating missing linked entities from existing person note data. Designed for users who imported GEDCOM before Canvas Roots supported event, place, or source note types.

See [data-enhancement-pass.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/data-enhancement-pass.md) for implementation plan.

**Use Cases:**
- Imported GEDCOM before v0.10.0: No event notes were created; birth/death dates are flat properties
- Imported GEDCOM before v0.9.0: No source notes; source citations were ignored
- Have place strings instead of wikilinks: `birthPlace: "Dublin, Ireland"` instead of `birthPlace: "[[Dublin, Ireland]]"`
- Want event notes for existing data: Retroactively create event notes to use timeline features

**Generate Place Notes (v0.10.17):**
- Scans person notes for `birth_place`, `death_place` properties
- Scans event notes for `place` properties
- Detects string values (not wikilinks) that need conversion
- Creates place notes with proper hierarchy (parents created first)
- Updates references to use wikilinks
- Preview mode shows what will be created/modified
- Matches existing place notes to avoid duplicates
- Progress indicator during bulk generation with cancel support
- Paginated results table with search/sort after completion
- Edit button on each result to open Edit Place modal

**Planned Features:**
- Generate Events from Dates: Create event notes from person `birthDate`/`deathDate` properties
- Re-parse GEDCOM for Sources: Re-import GEDCOM to extract sources, matching to existing person notes

---

### Type Customization (v0.10.3)

Full type manager for each note category: events, sources, organizations, relationships, and places. Create, edit, hide, and customize types and categories with user-defined names.

**Type Managers:**

Each Control Center tab now includes a "Manage types" card:

| Tab | Types | Features |
|-----|-------|----------|
| Events | 22 built-in event types | Custom types, categories (Core, Extended, Narrative), icon/color |
| Sources | 6 built-in source types | Custom types, categories, description |
| Organizations | 11 built-in org types | Custom types, categories |
| Relationships | 17 built-in relationship types | Custom types, color, line style (solid, dashed, dotted) |
| Places | 15 built-in place types | Custom types, categories, hierarchy level (0-99) |

**Type Management Features:**
- **Create custom types**: Add new types with full customization
- **Override built-in types**: Change name, description, icon, color
- **Hide types**: Remove from dropdowns while preserving existing notes
- **Reset to defaults**: Restore customized built-in types
- **Delete custom types**: Remove user-created types entirely

**Category Management:**
- Create custom categories to group related types
- Rename built-in categories to match your terminology
- Reorder categories with sort order field
- Hide unused categories (built-in or custom)
- "Show all" button to restore hidden categories

**Place Type Specifics:**
- Hierarchy levels (0-99) determine valid parent-child relationships
- Categories (geographic, political, settlement, subdivision, structure) organize the UI
- Users can assign place types to any category regardless of hierarchy
- Quick level presets for common hierarchy positions

**Settings Storage:**
```typescript
// Per-category settings (events shown as example)
customEventTypes: EventTypeDefinition[];
eventTypeCustomizations: Record<string, Partial<EventTypeDefinition>>;
hiddenEventTypes: string[];
customEventCategories: EventCategoryDefinition[];
categoryCustomizations: Record<string, Partial<EventCategoryDefinition>>;
hiddenCategories: string[];
```

**Use Cases:**
- Rename "birth" to "nameday" for fantasy world-building
- Add "coronation" and "succession" event types for dynasty tracking
- Create "Land Records" source type for property research
- Hide unused relationship types like "apprentice" or "mentor"
- Add "Bodies of Water" category for place types

---

### Flexible Note Type Detection (v0.10.2)

Support multiple methods for identifying Canvas Roots note types, avoiding conflicts with other plugins that use the `type` property.

**Problem Solved:**
- The generic `type` property conflicts with other plugins (Templater, Dataview, etc.)
- Some users prefer tags (`#person`) over frontmatter properties
- Need a namespaced property to avoid conflicts

**New Standard: `cr_type`**

New installations now use `cr_type` as the primary type property:
```yaml
cr_type: person
```

This aligns with the existing `cr_id` convention and avoids conflicts with other plugins.

**Detection Methods (checked in order):**
1. **`cr_type` property** - New default, namespaced to avoid conflicts (e.g., `cr_type: person`)
2. **`type` property** - Legacy fallback for existing vaults (e.g., `type: person`)
3. **Tags** - Additional fallback via tags (`#person`, `#place`, `#event`, `#source`, `#map`, `#organization`)
   - Supports nested tags (e.g., `#genealogy/person`)

**Settings:**
- **Primary type property**: Choose between `cr_type` (default) or `type` (legacy)
- **Enable tag-based detection**: Toggle tags as fallback detection method

**Supported Note Types:**
- `person` - Person notes with family relationships
- `place` - Place notes with geographic data
- `event` - Event notes for chronological mapping
- `source` - Source notes for evidence management
- `map` - Custom map configuration notes
- `organization` - Organization notes for hierarchies
- `schema` - Schema validation notes
- `proof_summary` - GPS proof summary notes

**Backwards Compatibility:**
- Existing users automatically keep `type` as their primary (migrated on first load)
- Both properties are always checked (primary first, then fallback)
- Person notes with `cr_id` but no explicit type are still detected as persons
- No migration of existing notes required

---

### GEDCOM Import v2 (v0.10.1)

Enhanced GEDCOM import that creates source notes, event notes, and place notes in addition to person notes.

**Import Options UI:**
- Toggle for each note type: people, events, sources, places
- Filename format selection: Original (John Smith.md), Kebab-case (john-smith.md), Snake_case (john_smith.md)
- Per-type filename formats via "Customize per note type" toggle
- Progress modal showing import phases with running statistics
- File analysis with counts before confirming import

**Source Import:**
- Parse `SOUR` records and `@S1@`-style source references
- Create source notes (`cr_type: source`) with available metadata
- Support for `TITL`, `AUTH`, `PUBL`, `REPO` fields

**Event Import:**
- Create event notes (`cr_type: event`) for all supported GEDCOM tags:
  - **Core (4):** `BIRT`, `DEAT`, `MARR`, `DIV`
  - **Life Events (6):** `BURI`, `CREM`, `ADOP`, `GRAD`, `RETI`, `CENS`
  - **Career/Residence (3):** `RESI`, `OCCU`, `EDUC`
  - **Legal/Estate (4):** `PROB`, `WILL`, `NATU`, `MILI`
  - **Migration (2):** `IMMI`, `EMIG`
  - **Religious (8):** `BAPM`, `CHR`, `CHRA`, `CONF`, `FCOM`, `ORDN`, `BARM`, `BASM`, `BLES`
  - **Family (7):** `ENGA`, `MARB`, `MARC`, `MARL`, `MARS`, `ANUL`, `DIVF`
- Preserve date precision from GEDCOM (`ABT`, `BEF`, `AFT`, `BET`)

**Person Attributes (stored as properties):**
- `DSCR` → `physicalDescription`
- `IDNO` → `identityNumber` (sensitive - redacted from exports)
- `NATI` → `nationality`
- `RELI` → `religion`
- `TITL` → `title`
- `PROP` → `property`
- `CAST` → `caste`
- `NCHI` → `childrenCount`
- `NMR` → `marriageCount`
- `SSN` → `ssn` (sensitive - redacted from exports)

**Place Import:**
- Hierarchical place structure parsing (`City, County, State, Country`)
- Create place notes (`type: place`) with parent/child relationships
- Duplicate detection: case-insensitive matching on `full_name` property
- Fallback matching: title + parent combination for same-named places
- Update existing places (add missing parent links) instead of creating duplicates

**Performance:**
- Optimized connected components analysis (O(n+m) instead of O(n×m))
- Paginated People tab (100 at a time) for large imports
- Progress callback throughout all import phases

**Integration Points:**
- Staging folder support (import to staging, review, then merge)
- Property aliases (use configured property names)
- Value aliases (map GEDCOM event types to Canvas Roots types)

---

### Chronological Story Mapping (v0.10.0)

---

## v0.9.x

### Value Aliases (v0.9.4)

Extend Property Aliases to support custom property *values*. Allows users with existing vaults to use custom terminology (e.g., `nameday` instead of `birth` for event types) without editing existing notes.

See [value-aliases.md](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/archive/value-aliases.md) for implementation plan.

**Features:**
- Map custom values to Canvas Roots canonical values
- Support for three field types:
  - **Event type**: `birth`, `death`, `marriage`, `burial`, `residence`, `occupation`, `education`, `military`, `immigration`, `baptism`, `confirmation`, `ordination`, `custom`
  - **Sex**: `male`, `female`, `nonbinary`, `unknown`
  - **Place category**: `real`, `historical`, `disputed`, `legendary`, `mythological`, `fictional`
- Graceful fallback: unknown event types treated as `custom`
- Unified "Aliases" card in Preferences with property names and property values sections

---

### Property Aliases (v0.9.3)
