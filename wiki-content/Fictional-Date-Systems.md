# Fictional Date Systems

Fictional Date Systems allow you to define custom calendars and eras for world-building, historical fiction, and alternate history research. This enables proper date handling for universes like Middle-earth (Third Age, Fourth Age), Westeros (years since Aegon's Conquest), or your own custom fictional worlds.

## Overview

Fictional Date Systems support:

- **Era-based dating**: Define eras with names, abbreviations, and epoch offsets
- **Date parsing**: Recognize formats like "TA 2941" or "AC 283"
- **Canonical years**: Convert fictional dates to absolute timeline positions for sorting
- **Age calculation**: Calculate ages within a single calendar system
- **Universe scoping**: Link calendar systems to specific universes

## Built-in Calendars

Canvas Roots includes four built-in calendar presets that you can enable or disable:

### Middle-earth Calendar

For Tolkien's Legendarium. Covers the major ages of Arda:

| Era | Abbreviation | Epoch | Notes |
|-----|--------------|-------|-------|
| First Age | FA | -6500 | Ends with defeat of Morgoth |
| Second Age | SA | -3441 | 3441 years, ends with defeat of Sauron |
| Third Age | TA | 0 | Reference point, 3021 years |
| Fourth Age | FoA | 3021 | Age of Men |

**Example dates**: `TA 2941` (Bilbo's adventure), `FoA 61` (Bilbo's departure)

### Westeros Calendar

For A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones. Uses Aegon's Conquest as epoch:

| Era | Abbreviation | Direction | Notes |
|-----|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Before Conquest | BC | Backward | Years before Aegon's landing |
| After Conquest | AC | Forward | Years after Aegon's landing |

**Example dates**: `AC 283` (Robert's Rebellion), `BC 100` (100 years before conquest)

### Star Wars Calendar

Uses the Battle of Yavin as epoch:

| Era | Abbreviation | Direction | Notes |
|-----|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Before the Battle of Yavin | BBY | Backward | Pre-Original Trilogy |
| After the Battle of Yavin | ABY | Forward | Post-Original Trilogy |

**Example dates**: `BBY 19` (Order 66), `ABY 4` (Battle of Endor)

### Generic Fantasy Calendar

A simple numbered age system for custom worlds:

| Era | Abbreviation | Epoch |
|-----|--------------|-------|
| First Age | A1 | -2000 |
| Second Age | A2 | -1000 |
| Third Age | A3 | 0 |
| Fourth Age | A4 | 1000 |

## Using Fictional Dates

### In Person Notes

Use fictional dates in the `born` and `died` frontmatter fields:

```yaml
---
name: Bilbo Baggins
universe: middle-earth
born: "TA 2890"
died: "FoA 61"
---
```

```yaml
---
name: Eddard Stark
universe: westeros
born: "AC 263"
died: "AC 298"
---
```

### Date Format

The parser recognizes dates in the format `{abbreviation} {year}`:

- `TA 2941` - Third Age, year 2941
- `AC 283` - After Conquest, year 283
- `BBY 19` - 19 years Before the Battle of Yavin
- `A2 500` - Second Age (generic), year 500

The abbreviation matching is case-insensitive (`TA`, `ta`, `Ta` all work).

---

## Managing Date Systems

### Accessing Settings

1. Open the Control Center (command palette: "Open Control Center")
2. Navigate to the **Canvas settings** tab
3. Scroll to the **Fictional date systems** card

### Enable/Disable Fictional Dates

Toggle **Enable fictional dates** to turn the feature on or off globally.

### Show/Hide Built-in Systems

Toggle **Show built-in systems** to include or exclude the preset calendars (Middle-earth, Westeros, Star Wars, Generic Fantasy).

### Viewing Built-in Systems

The built-in systems are displayed in a table showing:
- **Name**: The calendar system name
- **Eras**: List of era abbreviations
- **Universe**: The universe scope (if any)
- **View**: Click the eye icon to view full details

---

## Creating Custom Systems

### Add a New System

1. Click **Add date system** in the Fictional date systems card
2. Fill in the system details:
   - **Name**: Display name (e.g., "My World Calendar")
   - **ID**: Auto-generated from name, or customize
   - **Universe**: Optional scope to link with person notes
3. Add eras using **+ Add era**
4. Configure each era:
   - **Name**: Full era name (e.g., "Age of Legends")
   - **Abbrev**: Short abbreviation used in dates (e.g., "AoL")
   - **Epoch**: Year offset from reference point (0 for primary era)
   - **Direction**: Forward (years increase) or Backward (like BC)
5. Select a **Default era** for new dates
6. Click **Save**

### Understanding Epochs

The epoch determines how eras relate to each other on a timeline:

- **Epoch 0**: The reference point
- **Positive epochs**: Later eras (e.g., Fourth Age starting at year 3021)
- **Negative epochs**: Earlier eras (e.g., Second Age starting at -3441)

For example, in Middle-earth:
- Third Age epoch = 0 (reference)
- Fourth Age epoch = 3021 (TA 3021 = FoA 1)
- Second Age epoch = -3441 (SA 1 = canonical year -3440)

### Editing Custom Systems

1. Find the system in the **Custom systems** section
2. Click the edit icon (pencil)
3. Make changes and click **Save**

### Deleting Custom Systems

1. Click the delete icon (trash) next to the custom system
2. Confirm deletion

**Note**: Built-in systems cannot be edited or deleted, only hidden.

---

## Test Date Parsing

Use the **Test date parsing** input to validate dates:

1. Enter a date string (e.g., "TA 2941")
2. See instant feedback:
   - **Success** (green): Shows era name, year, system, and canonical year
   - **Error** (red): Shows what went wrong

This helps verify that your custom systems are configured correctly.

---

## Technical Details

### Canonical Years

Fictional dates are converted to canonical years for sorting and comparison:

```
Canonical Year = epoch + (year × direction)
```

Where direction is +1 for forward eras and -1 for backward eras.

**Examples**:
- `TA 2941` → canonical 2941 (epoch 0 + 2941)
- `FoA 1` → canonical 3022 (epoch 3021 + 1)
- `SA 3441` → canonical 0 (epoch -3441 + 3441)
- `BBY 19` → canonical -19 (epoch 0 + 19 × -1)

### Age Calculation

Ages are calculated as the difference between canonical years:

```
Age = death_canonical - birth_canonical
```

For `TA 2890` to `FoA 61`:
- Birth canonical: 2890
- Death canonical: 3021 + 61 = 3082
- Age: 3082 - 2890 = 192 years (Bilbo lived to 131 in the books, so this simplified model doesn't account for the Shire Reckoning)

### Settings Storage

Date systems are stored in plugin settings:

```typescript
{
  enableFictionalDates: true,
  showBuiltInDateSystems: true,
  fictionalDateSystems: [
    // Custom systems stored here
  ]
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Calendarium Integration (Planned)

Canvas Roots plans to support integration with the popular [Calendarium](https://github.com/javalent/calendarium) community plugin. This will enable:

- **Calendar sharing**: Use Calendarium's calendar definitions in Canvas Roots
- **Event synchronization**: Display Canvas Roots events in Calendarium's calendar views
- **Bidirectional sync**: Optionally keep events in sync between both systems
- **Cross-calendar translation**: Convert dates between different calendar systems

If you use Calendarium for fantasy calendar management, this integration will allow you to leverage your existing calendar definitions while using Canvas Roots' genealogy and worldbuilding features.

See the [Chronological Story Mapping plan](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/blob/main/docs/planning/chronological-story-mapping.md) for full details on this planned integration.
