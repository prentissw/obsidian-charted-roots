## Folder Locations

Configure where Charted Roots stores and looks for different note types.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **People folder** | `Charted Roots/People` | Default folder for person notes |
| **Places folder** | `Charted Roots/Places` | Default folder for place notes |
| **Map notes folder** | `Charted Roots/Places/Maps` | Default folder for map notes |
| **Organizations folder** | `Charted Roots/Organizations` | Default folder for organization notes |
| **Sources folder** | `Charted Roots/Sources` | Default folder for source notes |
| **Events folder** | `Charted Roots/Events` | Default folder for event notes |
| **Schemas folder** | `Charted Roots/Schemas` | Default folder for validation schemas |
| **Canvases folder** | `Charted Roots/Canvases` | Default folder for generated canvas files |
| **Bases folder** | `Charted Roots/Bases` | Folder for Obsidian Bases templates |
| **Staging folder** | *(empty)* | Folder for import staging (isolated from main operations) |

### Staging Folder

The staging folder is used for importing GEDCOM/CSV files before merging into your main tree. When configured:

- Imported notes go to the staging folder first
- The staging folder is excluded from normal operations (tree generation, duplicate detection)
- You can review and merge staged notes using the Import/Export tab

Set **Enable staging isolation** to automatically exclude the staging folder from normal scans.

### Media Folders

Control which folders Charted Roots scans when discovering media files.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Limit media scanning to specified folders** | Off | When enabled, only scan listed folders for media |
| **Media folders** | *(empty)* | List of folders to scan (one per line) |

When enabled, folder filtering affects:
- **Find Unlinked** results in the Media Manager
- **Media Manager statistics** (total files, coverage percentage)
- **Media picker** file lists when linking media

It does **not** affect:
- Already-linked media (always displayed regardless of location)
- **Linked Media Gallery** (shows all linked media)
- Media imported from Gramps packages

See [Media Management](Media-Management#media-folder-settings) for more details.

## Property Aliases

If your vault uses different property names than Charted Roots defaults, you can create **property aliases** to map your custom names to the canonical Charted Roots fields.

### Configuring Aliases

Go to **Settings → Charted Roots → Property & value aliases** to add, edit, or remove aliases.

### How Aliases Work

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Reading notes** | Charted Roots checks for the canonical property first, then falls back to your alias |
| **Creating/importing notes** | New notes use your aliased property name instead of the canonical name |
| **Both properties exist** | The canonical property takes precedence |

### Example

If your vault uses `birthdate` instead of `born`:

1. Add an alias: `birthdate` → `born`
2. Charted Roots will now read `birthdate` as the birth date
3. When importing GEDCOM files, notes will be created with `birthdate` instead of `born`
4. Bases templates will use `note.birthdate` in views and formulas

### Bases Templates and Aliases

When you create a new People base template (Control Center → Advanced → Create Bases template), it will use your configured aliases:

- Column references use aliased names (e.g., `note.birthdate` instead of `note.born`)
- Filter expressions use aliased names
- Formulas reference aliased properties

> **Note:** Existing Bases files are not automatically updated when aliases change. Delete and recreate the base file to apply new alias configurations.

### Supported Properties

| Category | Properties |
|----------|------------|
| Identity | `name`, `cr_id`, `gender`, `nickname`, `maiden_name` |
| Dates | `born`, `died` |
| Places | `birth_place`, `death_place` |
| Relationships | `father`, `father_id`, `mother`, `mother_id`, `spouse`, `spouse_id`, `child`, `children_id` |
| Other | `occupation`, `universe`, `image`, `sourced_facts`, `relationships` |

---

## Value Aliases

In addition to property names, you can also create **value aliases** to map custom property values to Charted Roots' canonical values. This is useful when your vault uses different terminology for enumerated fields.

### Configuring Value Aliases

Go to **Settings → Charted Roots → Property & value aliases → Value aliases** to add, edit, or remove value aliases.

### How Value Aliases Work

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| **Reading notes** | Charted Roots checks if the value is canonical first, then checks for an alias |
| **Unknown event types** | Unrecognized event types are treated as `custom` |
| **Unknown gender/place category** | Unrecognized values are passed through unchanged |

### Supported Fields

#### Event Types

Map custom event type values to canonical types:

| Canonical Value | Description | Example Aliases |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `birth` | Birth of a person | `nameday`, `born` |
| `death` | Death of a person | `passing`, `died` |
| `marriage` | Marriage ceremony | `wedding`, `union` |
| `burial` | Burial or interment | `interment`, `funeral` |
| `residence` | Change of residence | `moved`, `relocation` |
| `occupation` | Employment change | `job`, `career` |
| `education` | Educational milestone | `school`, `graduated` |
| `military` | Military service | `service`, `enlisted` |
| `immigration` | Immigration or emigration | `moved_abroad`, `emigration` |
| `baptism` | Baptism ceremony | `christening` |
| `confirmation` | Religious confirmation | — |
| `ordination` | Religious ordination | — |
| `custom` | Custom/other event type | — |

#### Gender

Map custom gender values to canonical values:

| Canonical Value | Description | Example Aliases |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `male` | Male | `m`, `masc`, `man` |
| `female` | Female | `f`, `fem`, `woman` |
| `nonbinary` | Non-binary | `nb`, `enby`, `other` |
| `unknown` | Unknown | `?`, `unspecified` |

> **Note:** Charted Roots also recognizes legacy values `M` and `F` for compatibility with existing vaults.

#### Place Categories

Map custom place category values to canonical categories:

| Canonical Value | Description | Example Aliases |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| `real` | Real-world location | `actual`, `existing` |
| `historical` | Historical (no longer exists) | `former`, `past` |
| `disputed` | Disputed territory | `contested` |
| `legendary` | Legendary location | `mythical` |
| `mythological` | Mythological location | `myth` |
| `fictional` | Fictional location | `made_up`, `fantasy`, `canon` |

### Example

If your vault uses `nameday` instead of `birth` for event types:

1. Add a value alias: `nameday` → `birth` (Field: Event type)
2. Charted Roots will now treat `event_type: nameday` as a birth event
3. Birth markers will appear on maps for events with `nameday` type
