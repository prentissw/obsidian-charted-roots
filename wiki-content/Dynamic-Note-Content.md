## Overview

Dynamic content blocks solve the problem of person notes containing only static frontmatter. With these blocks, you can see a person's complete timeline, family relationships, and more without leaving the note.

**Key Features:**
- **Live rendering**: Content computed from your vault data
- **Freeze to markdown**: Convert to static text for editing or export
- **Configurable**: Options for sorting, filtering, and display
- **Multiple insertion methods**: Command palette, context menu, import wizards

## Block Types

### Timeline Block

The `canvas-roots-timeline` block shows a chronological list of events for a person.

~~~markdown
```canvas-roots-timeline
sort: chronological
```
~~~

**What it displays:**
- Birth and death dates from the person's frontmatter
- All event notes linked to this person
- Year, event type, and place for each entry
- Clickable wikilinks to event and place notes

**Configuration options:**

| Option | Values | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `sort` | `chronological`, `reverse` | Event order (default: chronological) |
| `include` | comma-separated types | Only show these event types |
| `exclude` | comma-separated types | Hide these event types |
| `limit` | number | Maximum events to display |
| `title` | string | Custom header text (default: "Timeline") |

**Example with options:**

~~~markdown
```canvas-roots-timeline
sort: reverse
exclude: residence, occupation
limit: 10
title: Key Life Events
```
~~~

### Relationships Block

The `canvas-roots-relationships` block displays family members with clickable links.

~~~markdown
```canvas-roots-relationships
type: immediate
```
~~~

**What it displays:**
- Parents (father, mother)
- Spouse(s)
- Children
- Siblings (when using `type: extended` or `type: all`)

Each person is shown as a wikilink with their birth-death years.

**Configuration options:**

| Option | Values | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `type` | `immediate`, `extended`, `all` | Relationship scope (default: immediate) |
| `include` | comma-separated types | Only show these relationship types |

**Example with options:**

~~~markdown
```canvas-roots-relationships
type: extended
title: Family Tree
```
~~~

### Media Block

The `canvas-roots-media` block displays a gallery of media files linked to the person.

~~~markdown
```canvas-roots-media
columns: 3
size: medium
```
~~~

**What it displays:**
- All media files linked via the `media` frontmatter property
- Image thumbnails in a responsive grid
- Document placeholders for non-image files (PDFs, etc.)
- First item highlighted as the "thumbnail" (used for Family Chart avatars)

**Configuration options:**

| Option | Values | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `columns` | 2-6, `auto` | Number of columns in grid (default: 3) |
| `size` | `small`, `medium`, `large` | Thumbnail size (default: medium) |
| `editable` | `true`, `false` | Enable drag-to-reorder (default: false) |
| `title` | string | Custom header text (default: "Media") |

**Example with options:**

~~~markdown
```canvas-roots-media
columns: 4
size: large
editable: true
title: Photos & Documents
```
~~~

**Editable Mode:**

When `editable: true` is set:
- Items show a drag handle on hover
- Drag items to reorder their position
- First item becomes the thumbnail (shown on Family Chart nodes)
- Frontmatter is updated automatically when you drop
- Gallery has a dashed border to indicate edit mode

### Source Roles Block

The `charted-roots-source-roles` block displays a table of people and their roles in a source document.

~~~markdown
```charted-roots-source-roles
source: "[[Estate Inventory of John Smith Sr.]]"
```
~~~

**What it displays:**
- All people listed in the source's role properties (`principals`, `witnesses`, `informants`, etc.)
- Role category and label for each person
- Role details (e.g., "Decedent", "Administrator") when present
- Clickable wikilinks to person notes

**Configuration options:**

| Option | Values | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `source` | wikilink | Source note to display roles from (default: current note) |

**Rendered output:**

| Role | Person | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Principal | [[John Smith Sr.]] | Decedent |
| Official | [[Thomas Brown]] | Administrator |
| Enslaved Individual | [[Mary]] | — |

**Inserting the block:**

1. **Context menu:** Right-click on a source note and select **Charted Roots > Add source roles block**
2. **Manual:** Add the code block to any note, specifying the source

When inserted via context menu, the `source` parameter is pre-filled with the current note's wikilink.

**Note:** This block is designed for source notes (`cr_type: source`) that have role properties defined. See [Person Roles in Sources](Evidence-And-Sources#person-roles-in-sources) for details on setting up role properties.

### Transfers Block

The `charted-roots-transfers` block displays a chronological list of transfer events for a person. This is useful for tracking ownership changes in genealogical research (e.g., enslaved ancestor tracking) or succession in worldbuilding.

~~~markdown
```charted-roots-transfers
sort: chronological
```
~~~

**What it displays:**
- All transfer events linked to this person
- Transfer type (inheritance, purchase, gift, hire, seizure, birth, relocation)
- Date and event title with clickable wikilink
- Location (if recorded)
- Other participants in the transfer

**Configuration options:**

| Option | Values | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `sort` | `chronological`, `reverse` | Event order (default: chronological) |
| `limit` | number | Maximum events to display |
| `title` | string | Custom header text (default: "Transfer history") |

**Example with options:**

~~~markdown
```charted-roots-transfers
sort: reverse
limit: 10
title: Ownership history
```
~~~

**Transfer types:**

| Type | Label | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `inheritance` | Inherited | Transfer at death via will/probate |
| `purchase` | Purchased | Sale transaction |
| `gift` | Gift | Transfer without payment |
| `hire` | Hired out | Temporary transfer (hiring out) |
| `seizure` | Seized | Court-ordered transfer, debt collection |
| `birth` | Born into | Born into ownership |
| `relocation` | Relocated | Move to different location (same owner) |

**Use cases:**
- **Genealogical research:** Track enslaved ancestors through ownership chains, estate divisions, and probate records
- **Worldbuilding:** Track succession of titles, thrones, and positions

**Related:** Transfer events require creating event notes with `event_type: transfer` and `transfer_type` property. See [Events & Timelines](Events-And-Timelines#event-types) for details on creating transfer events.

## Rendered Output

In reading view, code blocks render as styled containers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Timeline                               [❄️] │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • 1845 — Born in [[Dublin, Ireland]]        │
│ • 1867 — Married [[Jane Smith]]             │
│ • 1890 — Resided in [[Boston, MA]]          │
│ • 1912 — Died in [[Boston, MA]]             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Toolbar buttons:**
- ❄️ **Freeze**: Convert to static markdown
- 📋 **Copy**: Copy timeline text to clipboard (timeline only)

**Empty states:**
- If no data is found, blocks show a helpful message
- Example: "No events found for this person"

## Freeze to Markdown

Click the ❄️ freeze button to convert a live block to static markdown. This is useful for:

- **Manual editing**: Add notes, reorder items, customize formatting
- **Export compatibility**: Static markdown works everywhere
- **Performance**: Reduce computation in large vaults

**Before freezing:**

~~~markdown
```canvas-roots-timeline
sort: chronological
```
~~~

**After freezing:**

```markdown
## Timeline

- **1845** — Born in [[Dublin, Ireland]]
- **1867** — [[Marriage of John and Jane|Married]] in [[Boston, MA]]
- **1912** — Died in [[Boston, MA]]
```

The frozen content preserves wikilinks and can be edited like any markdown.

**Media gallery freeze:**

Media galleries freeze to a styled callout that displays images in a responsive grid:

~~~markdown
> [!info|cr-frozen-gallery]
> ![[portrait.jpg]]
> ![[wedding-photo.jpg]]
> ![[birth-certificate.pdf]]
~~~

The frozen gallery:
- Uses Obsidian's native callout syntax with a special `cr-frozen-gallery` metadata tag
- Renders images in a flex layout with configurable styling
- Click-and-hold on an image to zoom to full screen
- Styling can be customized via the Style Settings plugin

## Inserting Blocks

### Create Person Modal

When creating a new person note via the Create Person modal, enable the "Include dynamic blocks" toggle to automatically add timeline, relationships, and media blocks to the note body.

### Import Wizards

All import wizards (GEDCOM, Gramps, CSV) include an "Include dynamic blocks" toggle. When enabled, imported person notes will include all three block types. Media blocks are included with `editable: true` by default.

### Context Menu

Right-click on a person note in the file explorer:

1. Select **Insert dynamic blocks**
2. Timeline, relationships, and media blocks are added to the note body

### Bulk Insert (Folders)

Right-click on a folder containing person notes:

1. Select **Insert dynamic blocks in folder**
2. A progress modal shows the operation
3. Blocks are added to all person notes in the folder that don't already have them

### Command Palette

Use the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`):

- **Charted Roots: Insert dynamic blocks** - Adds blocks to the current note

### Manual Entry

Type the code block syntax directly in any person note:

~~~markdown
```canvas-roots-timeline
```

```canvas-roots-relationships
```
~~~

## Tips

- **Placement**: Add blocks after your frontmatter and any static content you want to keep at the top
- **Multiple blocks**: You can have both timeline and relationships blocks in the same note
- **Re-ordering**: Frozen content can be moved anywhere in the note
- **Performance**: For large vaults (1000+ people), consider using frozen blocks to avoid computation on every note open
- **cr_id required**: Blocks only work in notes with a valid `cr_id` property
