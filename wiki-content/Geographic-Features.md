3. If "-copy" already exists, it becomes "-copy-2", "-copy-3", etc.
4. The duplicate opens immediately in edit mode

### Exporting and Importing Maps

**Export to JSON:**
1. Right-click a thumbnail → **Export to JSON**
2. Save the JSON file to your computer
3. The file contains all map frontmatter properties

**Import from JSON:**
1. Click **Import JSON** button in the Custom Maps card
2. Select a JSON file from your computer
3. If a map with the same ID exists, you'll be warned
4. The imported map note is created in your maps folder

### Custom Image Maps

For fictional worlds or historical maps, you can use your own map images:

1. Create a map note with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   type: map
   map_id: westeros
   name: Westeros
   universe: got
   image: assets/maps/westeros.png
   bounds:
     north: 50
     south: -50
     west: -100
     east: 100
   ---
   ```

2. Create place notes with the matching universe and coordinates
3. In Map View, use the **Map** dropdown to switch to your custom map

**Coordinate Systems:**
- **Geographic** (default): Uses lat/lng coordinates
- **Pixel**: Uses pixel coordinates (`pixel_x`, `pixel_y`) - ideal for hand-drawn maps

## Place Notes

Place notes are structured markdown files with YAML frontmatter that describe locations. They support hierarchical relationships (city → state → country) and can be linked from person notes.

**Example Place Note:**

```yaml
---
type: place
cr_id: place_abc123
name: "London"
aliases:
  - "City of London"
  - "Londinium"

# Classification
place_category: real  # real | historical | disputed | legendary | mythological | fictional
universe: null        # for fictional/mythological places

# Hierarchy
parent_place: "[[England]]"
place_type: city

# Coordinates (for real/historical places)
coordinates:
  lat: 51.5074
  long: -0.1278

# Historical names
historical_names:
  - name: "Londinium"
    period: "Roman"
---

# London

Notes about this place...
```

### Place Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `real` | Verified real-world location | London, New York, Tokyo |
| `historical` | Real place that no longer exists | Babylon, Constantinople |
| `disputed` | Location debated by historians | Troy, King Solomon's Mines |
| `legendary` | May have historical basis but fictionalized | Camelot, El Dorado |
| `mythological` | Place from mythology/religion | Asgard, Mount Olympus |
| `fictional` | Invented for a story/world | Winterfell, Mordor |

### Creating Place Notes

**Option 1: Control Center**
1. Open Control Center → **Places** tab
2. Click **Create place note**
3. Fill in the place details:
   - Name and aliases
   - Category (real, historical, fictional, etc.)
   - Place type (city, state, country, etc.)
   - Parent place (searchable dropdown)
   - Coordinates (for real places)
4. Click **Create**

**Option 2: Quick-Create from Person Note**
1. Right-click on a person note
2. Select **Create place notes...**
3. Review unlinked place references (from birth_place, death_place, etc.)
4. Click **Create** for each place you want to add
5. Optionally enable auto-linking to convert text to wikilinks

**Option 3: Bulk Create Missing Places**
1. Open Control Center → **Places** tab → **Statistics**
2. Click **Create missing place notes**
3. Review places referenced in person notes but not yet created
4. Create them individually or in batch

### Linking Places to People

Reference places in person notes using wikilinks or plain text:

```yaml
---
# Wikilink format (recommended - creates graph connections)
birth_place: "[[London]]"
death_place: "[[New York City]]"
burial_place: "[[Westminster Abbey]]"

# Plain text format (backwards compatible)
birth_place: "London, England"
---
```

## Life Events Array

Beyond core life events (birth, death, marriage, burial), you can track additional life events using the `events` array in person frontmatter. These events appear as color-coded markers in the Map View.

### Supported Event Types

| Event Type | Color | Use For |
|------------|-------|---------|
| `residence` | Blue | Places lived (homes, apartments) |
| `occupation` | Orange | Work locations (offices, factories) |
| `education` | Teal | Schools, universities, training |
| `military` | Brown | Military service locations |
| `immigration` | Cyan | Border crossings, ports of entry |
| `baptism` | Light Purple | Baptism locations |
| `confirmation` | Light Purple | Confirmation ceremonies |
| `ordination` | Light Purple | Religious ordinations |
| `custom` | Pink | Any other life event |

### Example Events Array

```yaml
---
birth_place: "[[Boston]]"
death_place: "[[Miami]]"

events:
  - event_type: residence
    place: "[[New York]]"
    date_from: "1920"
    date_to: "1935"
    description: "Family home on 5th Ave"
  - event_type: occupation
    place: "[[Chicago]]"
    date_from: "1935"
    date_to: "1942"
    description: "Steel mill foreman"
  - event_type: military
    place: "[[Normandy]]"
    date_from: "1944-06-06"
    date_to: "1944-08-25"
    description: "D-Day invasion"
  - event_type: education
    place: "[[Harvard University]]"
    date_from: "1915"
    date_to: "1919"
    description: "BA in History"
---
```

### Event Properties

| Property | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `event_type` | Yes | One of the types listed above |
| `place` | Yes | Wikilink to a place note |
| `date_from` | No | Start date (YYYY, YYYY-MM, or YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `date_to` | No | End date (for duration events) |
| `description` | No | Brief description of the event |

## Journey Paths (Route Visualization)

Journey paths show a person's complete movement through life by connecting all their events in chronological order.

**How it works:**
- Birth location is always first
- Life events are sorted by date (year)
- Death and burial locations come last
- Consecutive duplicate locations are filtered out

**Visual style:**
- Dashed violet lines (distinct from solid indigo migration paths)
- Arrow decorations showing direction of movement
- Person name labels along the path
- Click the path to see all waypoints in a popup

**To enable:**
1. Open Map View
2. Click **Layers** in the toolbar
3. Check "Journey paths (all events)"

**Use cases:**
- Track immigration routes with multiple stops
- Visualize military service across locations
- Show career progression through cities
- Map pilgrimage or travel routes

## Place Statistics

The Places tab in Control Center shows aggregate statistics:

**Overview Metrics:**
- Total places in vault
- Percentage with coordinates
- Orphan places (no parent defined)
- Maximum hierarchy depth

**Category Breakdown:**
- Count of places per category
- Number of associated people per category

**Most Common Locations:**
- Top birth places
- Top death places
- Migration patterns (birth → death flows)

**Actions:**
- Create missing place notes
- Build hierarchy (assign parents to orphan places)
- Standardize place names (find and unify variations)
- View place index (alphabetical with person counts)

## Place Visualizations

Canvas Roots provides D3-based visualizations for place data:

**Network/Schematic View:**
- Places shown as nodes sized by associated person count
- Color coding by category, place type, or hierarchy depth
- Tree and radial layout options
- Interactive tooltips with place details
- Toggle migration flows as directed edges

**Migration Flow Diagram:**
- Arc diagram showing movement patterns between places
- Filter by minimum flow count
- Color-coded nodes (green=birth origin, red=death destination)
- Filter by time period (year range with century presets)
- Filter by collection (family branch)
- Aggregate by hierarchy level (e.g., group by country)

## Place-Based Tree Filtering

Filter tree generation by geographic data:

1. Open Control Center → **Tree Output** tab
2. Configure your tree settings
3. In the **Place filter** section:
   - Enable filtering by birth place, death place, marriage location, or burial place
   - Enter a place name to match
4. Generate tree with only people matching the place criteria

## Geocoding Lookup

For real, historical, or disputed places, look up coordinates automatically:

1. Create or edit a place note
2. Click **Look up coordinates** button
3. Canvas Roots queries Nominatim (OpenStreetMap geocoding)
4. Review and accept the suggested coordinates
5. Parent place is included in the query for better accuracy

**Note:** Geocoding is rate-limited. For bulk lookups, space requests appropriately.

## Custom Place Types

Beyond the built-in types (city, state, country, etc.), you can use custom types:

1. In the place type dropdown, select **Other...**
2. Enter your custom type (e.g., "galaxy", "star-system", "dimension")
3. Custom types are normalized to lowercase with hyphens
4. They appear in statistics alongside standard types

## Map Image Alignment (Edit Mode)

Custom map images often need adjustment to align properly with your coordinate system. The Map Image Alignment feature lets you interactively position, scale, rotate, and distort your map image to match geographic coordinates.

### When to Use Map Alignment

- **Historical maps**: Old maps may have different projections or orientations than modern coordinates
- **Fantasy/fictional maps**: Hand-drawn maps rarely align perfectly with a coordinate grid
- **Scanned images**: Scanning can introduce skew or distortion
- **Composite images**: Maps assembled from multiple sources may need adjustment

### Entering Edit Mode

1. Open the **Map View** (from ribbon icon or right-click a map note)
2. Select your custom map from the dropdown (not OpenStreetMap)
3. Click the **Edit** button in the toolbar
4. The edit banner appears with alignment controls

### Using the Corner Handles

When edit mode is active, four corner handles appear around your map image:

- **Drag any corner** to reposition that corner independently
- **Drag opposite corners** in opposite directions to scale the image
- **Drag adjacent corners** to rotate or skew the image
- The image updates in real-time as you drag

**Tip:** Start with small adjustments. It's easier to fine-tune alignment incrementally than to fix large distortions.

### Edit Banner Controls

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **Save alignment** | Save current corner positions to the map note's frontmatter |
| **Undo changes** | Revert to the last saved position (discards unsaved edits) |
| **Reset to default** | Clear all saved alignment and return to default rectangular bounds |
| **Cancel** | Exit edit mode without saving |

### How Alignment is Stored

Corner positions are saved as flat properties in your map note's frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: map
map_id: middle-earth
name: Middle-earth
image: assets/maps/middle-earth.jpg
bounds:
  north: 50
  south: -50
  west: -100
  east: 100
# Saved alignment corners
corner_nw_lat: 48.5
corner_nw_lng: -95.2
corner_ne_lat: 49.1
corner_ne_lng: -58.3
corner_sw_lat: -45.8
corner_sw_lng: -98.1
corner_se_lat: -44.2
corner_se_lng: -55.7
---
```

When corner properties are present, the map loads with that alignment. When they're absent, the map displays with default rectangular bounds.

### Best Practices

**Before aligning:**
- Identify reference points on your map (cities, coastlines, rivers)
- Know the approximate coordinates these points should have
- Consider the map's projection (most hand-drawn maps assume flat projection)

**During alignment:**
- Start with rough positioning of one corner
- Work around the map adjusting each corner
- Use known reference points to verify alignment
- Save frequently as you refine

**After alignment:**
- Test by adding place markers and verifying their positions
- Consider exporting the aligned map configuration for backup
- Document your reference points in the map note for future reference

### Limitations

- Alignment is saved per map note, not per image file
- Very large distortions may cause visual artifacts
- The underlying coordinate system remains unchanged; only the image position changes
- Alignment affects the Map View display only, not canvas generation

## Settings

Configure place features in Settings → Canvas Roots:

**Places Folder:**
- Default destination for new place notes
- Configurable via settings or folder context menu

**Default Place Category:**
- Global default category for new places
- Can be overridden by folder or collection rules

**Place Category Rules:**
- Define automatic category assignment based on folder path or collection
- Example: Places in "Places/Historical" default to `historical` category
