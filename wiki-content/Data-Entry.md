## Create Person Modal

The Create Person Modal provides a form-based interface for creating new person notes with all essential properties pre-populated.

### Opening the Modal

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Command palette | `Canvas Roots: Create person` |
| Dashboard | Click "Create Person" tile |
| Control Center | People tab → Actions → Create person |
| Folder context menu | Right-click a people folder → Create person |

### Features

- **Auto-generated cr_id** — Unique identifier created automatically
- **Folder selection** — Choose destination folder (pre-populated from folder context menu)
- **Basic fields** — Name, nickname, sex, birth date
- **State persistence** — If accidentally closed, your progress is saved and can be restored

### "Add Another" Flow

After creating a person, you have two options:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Create & Open** | Creates the person and opens the new note |
| **Create & Add Another** | Creates the person and resets the form to create another in the same folder |

The "Add Another" flow is useful when entering multiple family members in sequence.

## Family Creation Wizard

The Family Creation Wizard is a 5-step guided workflow for creating interconnected family groups with automatic bidirectional relationship linking.

### Opening the Wizard

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Command palette | `Canvas Roots: Create family wizard` |
| Dashboard | Click "Create Family" tile |
| Control Center | People tab → Actions → Create family |
| Folder context menu | Right-click a people folder → Create family |

### Workflow Steps

| Step | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Start | Choose Mode | Select "Start from Scratch" or "Build Around Person" |
| 1 | Central Person | Create the central person (skipped in "Build Around" mode) |
| 2 | Add Spouses | Add spouse(s) — create new or pick existing |
| 3 | Add Children | Add children — create new or pick existing |
| 4 | Add Parents | Add father and/or mother — create new or pick existing |
| 5 | Review | Preview family tree and confirm creation |

### Modes

**Start from Scratch**
- Create yourself first as the central person
- Add family members around you step by step
- All people are created fresh

**Build Around Person**
- Select an existing person from your vault
- Add family members around them
- Mix of existing and new people

### Features

- **Bidirectional linking** — All relationships are linked in both directions automatically
- **Existing person picker** — Select existing people instead of creating duplicates
- **Tree preview** — Visual preview shows the family structure before creation
- **State persistence** — Progress is saved if the wizard is accidentally closed
- **Relationship merging** — When building around an existing person, new relationships merge with existing ones

## Edit Modal Enhancements

The Edit Modal (opened by right-clicking a person note → Edit) includes features for managing relationships.

### Inline Person Creation

Create new people directly from relationship fields without leaving the Edit Modal:

1. Open the Edit Modal for a person
2. Find a relationship field (Spouse, Father, Mother, Children)
3. Click the **+** button next to the field
4. Fill in the mini-form (name, sex, birth date)
5. Click "Create" — the new person is created and linked automatically

### Children Management

The Edit Modal includes a dedicated Children section:

- **View existing children** — Displayed as clickable links
- **Add child via picker** — Click "Add existing" to select from your vault
- **Create new child** — Click "+" to create and link a new child inline

Children are stored using two array properties:
- `child` — Display names (wikilinks)
- `children_id` — cr_id references for robust linking

### Nickname Display

The Edit Modal header displays the person's nickname (if set) alongside their formal name, making it easy to identify people with informal names.

## Quick Start: Adding Properties via Context Menu

The fastest way to set up a person note is using the context menu:

1. Create a new markdown note for the person
2. Right-click the file in the file explorer
3. Select **Canvas Roots → Add essential person properties**

This automatically adds all required fields (`cr_id`, `cr_type`, `name`) plus common optional fields (`born`, `died`, `father`, `mother`, `spouse`). You can also select multiple files and add properties to all of them at once.

> **Tip:** See [Context Menus](Context-Menus) for all available right-click actions.

## Individual Markdown Notes

Create individual notes for each person with YAML frontmatter containing relationship data.

### Required Fields

- `cr_id`: Unique identifier (UUID format recommended)
- `cr_type`: Must be `"person"` for person notes
- `name`: Person's name

### Optional Relationship Fields

- `father`: Wikilink to father's note
- `father_id`: Father's `cr_id` value
- `mother`: Wikilink to mother's note
- `mother_id`: Mother's `cr_id` value
- `spouse`: Wikilink(s) to spouse(s)
- `spouse_id`: Spouse `cr_id` value(s)
- `children`: Array of wikilinks to children
- `children_id`: Array of children's `cr_id` values

### Optional Date Fields

- `born`: Birth date (YYYY-MM-DD format recommended)
- `died`: Death date (YYYY-MM-DD format recommended)

## Example Person Note

```yaml
---
cr_id: abc-123-def-456
cr_type: person
name: John Robert Smith
father: "[[John Smith Sr]]"
father_id: xyz-789-uvw-012
mother: "[[Jane Doe]]"
mother_id: pqr-345-stu-678
spouse: ["[[Mary Jones]]"]
spouse_id: ["mno-901-jkl-234"]
children: ["[[Bob Smith]]", "[[Alice Smith]]"]
children_id: ["def-456-ghi-789", "abc-123-xyz-456"]
born: 1888-05-15
died: 1952-08-20

# Research Notes

[Your biographical research, sources, and notes here...]
```

## Multiple Spouse Support

For complex marital histories, use indexed spouse properties:

```yaml
---
cr_id: abc-123-def-456
cr_type: person
name: John Robert Smith

# First spouse
spouse1: "[[Jane Doe]]"
spouse1_id: "jane-cr-id-123"
spouse1_marriage_date: "1985-06-15"
spouse1_divorce_date: "1992-03-20"
spouse1_marriage_status: divorced
spouse1_marriage_location: "Boston, MA"

# Second spouse
spouse2: "[[Mary Johnson]]"
spouse2_id: "mary-cr-id-456"
spouse2_marriage_date: "1995-08-10"
spouse2_marriage_status: current
spouse2_marriage_location: "Seattle, WA"
---
```

### Indexed Spouse Properties

For each spouse (spouse1, spouse2, etc.), you can specify:

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `spouseN` | Wikilink to spouse's note | `"[[Jane Doe]]"` |
| `spouseN_id` | Spouse's cr_id | `"jane-cr-id-123"` |
| `spouseN_marriage_date` | Wedding date | `"1985-06-15"` |
| `spouseN_divorce_date` | Divorce date (if applicable) | `"1992-03-20"` |
| `spouseN_marriage_status` | Status: current, divorced, widowed, annulled | `divorced` |
| `spouseN_marriage_location` | Wedding location | `"Boston, MA"` |

## Wikilinks vs IDs

Canvas Roots supports both wikilinks and ID-based relationships:

**Wikilinks** (`father`, `mother`, `spouse`, `children`):
- Human-readable in your notes
- Work with Obsidian's graph view and backlinks
- Require exact note name matches

**IDs** (`father_id`, `mother_id`, `spouse_id`, `children_id`):
- More robust - survive note renames
- Required for GEDCOM import/export
- Enable bidirectional sync features

**Best Practice:** Use both for maximum compatibility:

```yaml
father: "[[John Smith Sr]]"
father_id: xyz-789-uvw-012
```

## Bulk Data Entry

For entering many family members at once, consider using [Obsidian Bases](Bases-Integration) which provides a spreadsheet-like interface for editing frontmatter across multiple notes.

## Other Data Types

Canvas Roots also supports Places and Organizations, each with their own data entry workflows:

### Place Notes

Geographic locations for births, deaths, and other events. Place notes support:
- Coordinates (latitude/longitude) for map visualization
- Hierarchical relationships (parent places)
- Categories and universes for fictional locations

See [Geographic Features](Geographic-Features) for complete documentation.

### Organization Notes

Groups, institutions, and affiliations that people belong to. Organization notes support:
- Organization types (guild, corporation, noble house, etc.)
- Member relationships linking people to organizations
- Universe support for fictional world-building

See [Organization Notes](Organization-Notes) for complete documentation.
