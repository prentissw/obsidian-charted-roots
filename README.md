# Canvas Roots: Genealogical Family Tree Plugin for Obsidian

> **Beta Status (v0.2.3):** Canvas Roots is feature-complete for core genealogical workflows. All essential features are stable and production-ready (GEDCOM import/export, bidirectional sync, alternative layout algorithms, tree generation, canvas styling, collections). Advanced features are planned for future releases. See [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for details.

**Canvas Roots** is an Obsidian plugin that automatically generates complex family trees directly onto the Canvas using specialized genealogical layout algorithms for non-overlapping, relationship-aware positioning.

This plugin is designed for genealogists, historians, and world-builders. It transforms structured data in your Markdown notes (relationships, dates, locations) into perfectly laid-out family trees directly on the Obsidian Canvas, powered by the [family-chart](https://github.com/donatso/family-chart) library.

## ✨ Key Features

### Available in Beta (v0.2.3)

- **GEDCOM Import/Export:** Full round-trip support for GEDCOM 5.5.1 format with pre-import validation and comprehensive import results modal. Import family trees from popular genealogy software (Gramps, Ancestry, FamilySearch) with birth/death places, occupation, and gender data. Export back to .ged format with UUID preservation, collection codes, and marriage metadata.

- **Interactive Tree Preview:** Real-time visual preview of family trees before canvas generation. Pan, zoom, and explore layouts with interactive controls. Switch between color schemes (Gender, Generation, Monochrome) to visualize different data aspects. Hover over nodes to view person details (name, birth/death dates, generation). Export previews as high-resolution PNG or vector SVG for external use. Particularly useful for large trees (50+ people) to verify layout before generating the final canvas.

- **Alternative Layout Algorithms:** Choose from four layout algorithms to visualize your family tree in different ways:
  - **Standard:** Traditional family-chart layout with proper spouse handling
  - **Compact:** 50% tighter spacing for large trees (50+ people)
  - **Timeline:** Chronological positioning by birth year (shows who lived when)
  - **Hourglass:** Focus on one person's lineage (ancestors above, descendants below)

- **Automated Layout:** Generate precise, non-overlapping pedigree (ancestor) and descendant charts using specialized genealogical layout algorithms designed for complex family relationships.

- **Native Canvas Nodes:** Trees are built from Obsidian file nodes, making every person immediately linkable to research notes, images, and documents.

- **Multiple Tree Types:** Generate ancestor trees (pedigree charts), descendant trees, or full family trees. Configure generation limits, spouse inclusion, and layout direction.

- **Multi-Family Detection:** Automatically detects disconnected family groups. Generate all family trees at once or work with individual families.

- **Regenerate Canvas:** Update existing canvases with current relationship data and settings. Recalculate layout, apply new styling, and preserve tree metadata—all with a right-click.

- **Canvas Styling:** Comprehensive styling options: node coloring (gender-based, generation-based, or monochrome), arrow styles (directed, bidirectional, undirected), and edge colors. Configure parent-child and spouse relationships independently.

- **Multiple Spouse Support:** Track complex marital histories with flat indexed YAML properties (`spouse1`, `spouse2`, etc.) including marriage dates, locations, and status. Optionally display spouse edges with marriage metadata labels on the canvas (toggle in Canvas Settings).

- **Obsidian Bases Compatible:** Designed to work seamlessly with [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) for efficient bulk data entry and management. Includes ready-to-use Base template with six pre-configured relationship query views (Single Parents, Childless Couples, Multiple Marriages, Sibling Groups, Root Generation, Marked Root Persons).

- **Bidirectional Relationship Sync:** Automatically maintains reciprocal relationships across your family tree. When you set someone as a parent in one note, Canvas Roots automatically adds the child relationship in the parent's note. When you delete a relationship, the reciprocal link is automatically removed. Works seamlessly with Bases table edits, direct frontmatter modifications, and external editors.

- **Dual Storage System:** Combines human-friendly wikilinks with persistent `cr_id` references for robust relationship tracking that survives file renames and moves.

- **YAML-First Data:** Uses native YAML frontmatter for maximum compatibility with Dataview, Bases, and other Obsidian tools.

- **Context Menu Actions:** Right-click person notes to add relationships, validate data integrity, find canvases, or bulk-add essential properties. Generate trees quickly via "Generate tree" submenu (Canvas with full options, or Excalidraw with instant defaults). Right-click folders to scan for relationship issues, import GEDCOM files, or export folder contents to GEDCOM. Right-click canvas files to regenerate or view statistics. Multi-file selection support for batch operations. Full desktop and mobile support.

- **Collections & Groups:** Organize and browse people using auto-detected family groups (with customizable group names) or user-defined collections. Filter tree generation by collection and view cross-collection connections to identify bridge people connecting different parts of your family network.

- **Root Person Marking:** Mark specific people as "root persons" to track key lineage anchor points. Use the crown-icon context menu action to designate research starting points, track multiple lineages simultaneously, and filter root persons in Obsidian Bases views.

- **Excalidraw Export:** Export family tree canvases to Excalidraw format for manual annotation, drawing, and customization. Preserves node positioning and colors while enabling hand-drawn styling and freeform annotations.

### Planned Features

See [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) for detailed feature descriptions and development priorities.
- **Reference Numbering:** Ahnentafel and Dollarhide-Cole genealogical numbering systems
- **Person Detail Panel:** Rich inline person information with relationship visualization
- **Privacy & Obfuscation:** Optional data obfuscation for exports and canvas display
- **World-Building Features:** Track fantasy dynasties, corporate succession, and historical kingdoms
