## [0.12.9] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Family Chart "Open note" button** - Person cards in the Family Chart view now have a small button in the top-right corner that opens the person's note in a new tab. Works in both view and edit modes, providing quick access to notes without changing the card click behavior.

- **Statistics Dashboard** - New workspace view with comprehensive vault metrics including entity counts, data completeness percentages, gender distribution, and date range spanning all entities. Access via Control Center Statistics tab or command palette.

- **Data quality analysis** - Quality section with severity-coded alerts (error/warning/info) for date inconsistencies, missing birth/death dates, orphaned people, incomplete parents, unsourced events, and places without coordinates. All issues are expandable with drill-down to see affected records.

- **Top lists with drill-down** - Interactive lists for top surnames, locations, occupations, and sources. Click any item to expand and see all matching people as clickable chips with right-click context menu and hover preview.

- **Extended statistics** - Demographic analysis including longevity (average lifespan by birth decade and location), family size patterns, marriage patterns (age at marriage by sex, remarriage rates), migration flows (birth-to-death location changes with top routes), source coverage by generation, and timeline density with gap detection.

- **Genealogical reports** - Generate formatted reports from the Statistics Dashboard:
  - **Family Group Sheet** - Single family unit with parents, marriage, and children
  - **Individual Summary** - Complete record of one person with all events and sources
  - **Ahnentafel Report** - Numbered ancestor list (1=subject, 2=father, 3=mother, etc.)
  - **Gaps Report** - Analysis of missing data by category
  - **Register Report** - Descendants with NGSQ-style numbering
  - **Pedigree Chart** - Ancestor tree in markdown format
  - **Descendant Chart** - Descendant tree in markdown format

### Fixed

- **Orphaned people calculation** - Fixed bug where orphaned people count showed negative values due to incorrect subtraction of overlapping sets. Now correctly filters for people with no relationships at all.

---

## [0.12.8] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **Dynamic content blocks** - New `canvas-roots-timeline` and `canvas-roots-relationships` code blocks that render live, computed content in person notes. Timeline shows chronological events; relationships shows family members with wikilinks. Blocks can be frozen to static markdown via toolbar button.

- **Insert dynamic blocks** - Context menu actions and command palette command to insert dynamic blocks into existing person notes. Includes bulk insert for folders with progress indicator.

- **Dynamic blocks toggle in Create Person modal** - Option to include dynamic blocks when creating new person notes.

- **Dynamic blocks toggle in import wizards** - Option to include dynamic blocks in person notes during GEDCOM/Gramps/CSV import.

### Fixed

- **Family Chart zoom buttons causing NaN%** - Fixed issue where clicking zoom in/out buttons could show "NaN%" and cause the chart to vanish. The `manualZoom` function uses D3's `scaleBy` which multiplies the scale, so zoom in now uses 1.2 (20% larger) and zoom out uses 0.8 (20% smaller) instead of the incorrect additive values. Also added validation to detect invalid zoom state and reset to fit view if needed.

- **Family Chart showing wrong person** - Fixed "Open family chart" command showing a previously loaded person instead of the current note. Now correctly opens with the current note's person, or shows a person picker if no cr_id is found.

- **Family Chart opening in sidebar** - Fixed issue where the chart could open in the sidebar instead of the main workspace. The chart now prefers opening in the main workspace when launched from a person note.

---

## [0.12.7] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **Gramps source import** - Gramps XML import now creates source notes from `<sources>` and `<citations>` elements. Sources are linked to events via citation references. Includes repository metadata (`repository`, `repository_type`, `source_medium`), media reference handles for manual resolution (`gramps_media_refs`), and Gramps ID preservation (`gramps_handle`, `gramps_id`) for re-import scenarios.

- **Source property aliases** - Added source properties to the property alias system. Users can now customize property names for source notes (e.g., `creator` instead of `author`, `archive` instead of `repository`). Configure in Preferences → Property aliases → Source properties.

- **Gramps import progress indicator** - Gramps XML import now shows a progress modal with phase indicators and running statistics, matching the GEDCOM import experience.

- **Gramps import UI toggles** - Import options now use Obsidian-style toggles for "Create source notes", "Create place notes", and "Create event notes" with descriptions and destination folders.

- **Load testing tools** - Added parameterized GEDCOM generator (`gedcom-testing/generate-loadtest.js`) for creating test files of any size, performance testing documentation, and xxxlarge sample file (7,424 people) for stress testing.

### Changed

- **Unified Age formula in People base template** - Replaced separate `full_lifespan` and `age_now` formulas with a single intelligent `age` formula. Shows current age for living people, lifespan for deceased, and "Unknown" for people exceeding the configurable age threshold (set in Preferences → Privacy & Export). Living/Deceased view filters also use this threshold to categorize people without death dates.

### Fixed

- **Gramps XML import for compressed .gramps files** - Added support for importing gzip-compressed `.gramps` files exported from Gramps 6.x. The importer now automatically detects and decompresses gzip-compressed files. Previously, importing `.gramps` files would fail with "file does not appear to be a valid Gramps XML file" because the compressed binary data was not recognized as XML.

- **Family Chart "child has more than 1 parent" error** - Fixed crash when opening Family Chart after importing data with parent-child relationship inconsistencies. The chart now validates bidirectional relationships, only including children who explicitly reference the parent back. This handles cases where a parent's `child` field lists someone who doesn't list them as father/mother.

- **Family Chart refresh delay** - Removed unnecessary 2-second delay when chart updates from live note changes.

- **Duplicate relationship entries** - Added deduplication for `children_id` and `spouse_id` arrays to handle frontmatter with duplicate entries.

- **Duplicate child/children property after Gramps import** - Fixed inconsistent property naming where Gramps import created `child` property but bidirectional linking and data quality tools used `children`. All components now consistently use the canonical `child` property name for wikilinks (with `children_id` for cr_ids). Also fixed Gramps importer using `child_id` instead of `children_id`.

---

## [0.12.5] - 2025-12-14

### Added

- **Source Image Import Wizard** - New wizard in Sources tab (`Import` button) for bulk-importing source images. Parses filenames to extract metadata (surnames, years, record types, locations), shows confidence indicators, and creates source notes with media wikilinks attached. Supports multi-part document grouping for census pages and other multi-page records.

- **Source Media Linker Wizard** - New wizard in Sources tab (`Link` button) for attaching images to existing source notes that don't have media. Features smart suggestions with confidence scoring based on filename analysis, auto-selection of top matches, "+N more" badges showing alternative suggestions, and row highlighting for files needing manual selection.

- **Filename parser service** - New `ImageFilenameParser` service extracts metadata from common genealogy naming patterns (`surname_year_type`, `surname_given_byear_type`, descriptive names). Recognizes record type keywords (census, birth, death, marriage, military, immigration, obituary, etc.) and multi-part indicators (`_p1`, `_a`, `_page1`).

---

## [0.12.2] - 2025-12-14

### Fixed

- **Bases Lifespan formula error** - Fixed "Cannot find function 'year' on type Date" error in the Lifespan calculated property. Changed formula syntax from `.year()` method to `(date1 - date2).years.floor()` duration syntax which is correct for Obsidian Bases.

- **Bases Living/Deceased members views** - Fixed "Living members" and "Deceased members" views showing incorrect results when the `died` property exists but is empty. Changed filter from negation syntax to `isEmpty()` function which correctly handles both missing and empty property values. Added `name` to the view's `order` field so the Name column displays.

---

## [0.12.1] - 2025-12-14

### Changed

- **Family chart opens in main workspace** - "Open in family chart" now opens as a new tab in the main workspace instead of the sidebar, providing more screen space for viewing complex trees.

- **Context menu reorganization** - Moved "Open in family chart" into the "Generate tree" submenu for person notes, grouping all tree visualization options together. A separator distinguishes the interactive view from file-generating options.

### Fixed

- **cr_id prefix bug in context menu** - Fixed "Add essential place properties" and "Add essential event properties" context menu actions incorrectly adding `place_` or `event_` prefixes to generated cr_id values. The cr_type field already identifies the note type, so cr_id should be a plain UUID format.

- **Tree preview UI freeze on large trees** - Disabled tree preview for trees with more than 200 people to prevent UI freeze. Large trees show a notice with the count and recommendation to generate the canvas directly instead.

- **Canvas generation freeze on large trees** - Trees with more than 200 people now automatically use the D3 hierarchical layout instead of family-chart to prevent UI freeze. Spouse positioning may be less accurate for very large trees, but the canvas will generate successfully.

- **Canvas files not using configured folder** - Generated canvas files now correctly use the "Canvases folder" setting from Preferences. Previously, canvases were created in the vault root instead of the configured folder.

- **Excalidraw files created in wrong folder** - Exported Excalidraw files are now saved to the vault root instead of the source file's parent folder (e.g., People folder). This applies to canvas-to-Excalidraw exports, timeline exports, and person-to-Excalidraw exports.

---

## [0.12.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added

- **Calendarium integration (Phase 1)** - Canvas Roots can now import calendar definitions from the [Calendarium](https://github.com/javalent/calendarium) plugin. When Calendarium is installed and enabled, an "Integrations" card appears in Control Center Preferences with a toggle to enable read-only calendar import. Imported calendars appear in the "From Calendarium" section of the Date Systems card and can be selected when creating events with fictional dates. This eliminates the need to manually recreate calendar systems that are already defined in Calendarium.

### Changed

- **Stricter ESLint rules** - Added `await-thenable`, `no-base-to-string`, `no-console`, `no-case-declarations`, and `no-constant-condition` rules. Fixed all violations across the codebase.

---

## [0.11.9] - 2025-12-13

### Fixed

- **GEDCOM import race condition with BidirectionalLinker** - Fixed race condition where the BidirectionalLinker would modify files during Phase 1 of import before Phase 2 could replace GEDCOM IDs with cr_ids. The linker is now suspended during import and resumed after completion.

- **GEDCOM import regex substring matching** - Fixed ID replacement where shorter IDs (e.g., `I2`) would match within longer IDs (e.g., `I27`), causing corrupt cr_id formats like `jvc-874-coq-7457`. Replacements are now sorted by length (descending) with lookahead assertions to prevent partial matches.

- **GEDCOM import children_id not replaced in Phase 2** - Fixed missing children_id replacement during relationship update phase. Child references from family records are now collected and replaced alongside parent/spouse IDs.

- **GEDCOM import duplicate name corruption** - Fixed post-import relationship sync corrupting data when importing files with duplicate names (e.g., two "John Smith" people). The sync matched by filename rather than cr_id, causing relationship data to merge incorrectly. GEDCOM data already contains complete bidirectional relationships, so the sync is now skipped.

- **Data quality: corrupt cr_id detection** - Added validation for cr_id format (xxx-123-xxx-123) in orphan reference checks. Invalid formats are now flagged as errors to catch import corruption.

---

## [0.11.8] - 2025-12-13

### Fixed

- **Base templates: columns not visible by default** - Fixed an issue where Obsidian Bases templates for Events, Sources, Organizations, and Places did not display columns by default. The templates had `sort` (which controls sorting direction) but were missing `order` (which controls visible columns). Added `order` arrays to the first view in each template specifying which columns to display.

- **Descendant tree canvas export missing edges** - Fixed a bug where descendant tree canvas exports had no connecting arrows between person cards. The `buildDescendantTree()` function was creating edges with `type: 'child'` which were filtered out by the canvas generator (which skips child edges to avoid duplicates). Changed edge type to `'parent'` so edges are properly included in the export.

---

## [0.11.7] - 2025-12-12

### Added

- **Context menu for person links in Parent claim conflicts** - Right-click on person names in the Parent claim conflicts table to open in new tab or new window.

---

## [0.11.6] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed

- **GEDCOM import: children_id not replaced with cr_id values** - Fixed missing `children_id` replacement logic in `gedcom-importer.ts` and incorrect field name (`child_id` instead of `children_id`) in `gedcomx-importer.ts`. Now all relationship ID fields are properly replaced during import.

---

## [0.11.5] - 2025-12-12

Obsidian plugin review fixes (Round 12) and GEDCOM import bug fix.

### Fixed

- **GEDCOM import: parent IDs not replaced for duplicate names** - Fixed an issue where `father_id`, `mother_id`, `spouse_id`, and `children_id` properties retained GEDCOM IDs (e.g., `I2060`) instead of being replaced with `cr_id` values when importing people with duplicate names. The issue occurred because the relationship update phase looked for files by regenerating the filename, which didn't account for numeric suffixes added to handle duplicates (e.g., `John Smith 1.md`). Now tracks actual file paths during creation and uses them for relationship updates. Fixed in all three importers: `gedcom-importer.ts`, `gedcom-importer-v2.ts`, and `gedcomx-importer.ts`.

### Changed

- **PR review compliance (Round 12)** - Addressed all required items from Obsidian plugin review:
  - Fixed 27 floating promises by adding `void` or `await` as appropriate
  - Fixed lexical declaration in case block by wrapping in braces
  - Fixed `element.style.visibility` usage to use `setCssStyles()` instead
  - Removed `async` keyword from 4 methods that didn't use `await`
  - Added defensive object handling in YAML serialization to prevent `[object Object]`
  - Analyzed 449 sentence case flags - all determined to be false positives (proper nouns, product names, already sentence case)

- **PR review optional items** - Cleaned up deprecated code:
  - Removed unused template exports (`BASE_TEMPLATE`, `PLACES_BASE_TEMPLATE`, `EVENTS_BASE_TEMPLATE`)
  - Replaced `Vault.delete()` with `FileManager.trashFile()` to respect user preferences
  - Removed unused variables and function definitions

---

## [0.11.4] - 2025-12-12

Obsidian plugin review fixes (Round 11) and bug fixes.

### Changed

- **PR review compliance** - Addressed all required and optional items from Obsidian plugin review:
  - Replaced direct `style.x =` assignments with `style.setProperty()` for CSP compliance
  - Wrapped async event handlers with `void (async () => {...})()` pattern to handle floating promises
  - Removed unused imports across the codebase

### Fixed

- **Person picker showing non-person notes** - Fixed the "Select person" modal (used when linking Father/Mother/Spouse in Create Person) incorrectly listing place, event, and source notes alongside person notes

- **Timeline callout vertical line alignment** - Fixed the vertical line in markdown timeline exports not aligning with the dot markers

- **People base showing non-person notes** - Fixed the "Create People base" template including place, event, and source notes in the family members view

- **Events base template not working** - Rewrote the Events base template to use correct Obsidian Bases syntax (matching the working People base template structure). Added formulas for date formatting and duration calculations

- **Improved "Create base" button descriptions** - Updated descriptions for People, Events, Places, and Sources base buttons to explain that users need to click "Properties" after creating to enable additional columns

### Docs

- **Guide tab cleanup guidance** - Added post-import cleanup content to the Guide tab:
  - New "After importing" card with quick 4-step workflow overview
  - Added "Post-import cleanup" to Key Concepts section
  - Added "Clean up data" to Common Tasks grid

- **Data Quality wiki** - Added "Post-Import Cleanup Workflow" section with recommended 8-step sequence and tool locations

- **Roadmap** - Added "Post-Import Cleanup Wizard" as high-priority planned feature

---

## [0.11.3] - 2025-12-12

GEDCOM Import: Pre-import data quality preview with place name standardization, plus Control Center UI consistency improvements.

### Added

- **GEDCOM import data quality preview** - New pre-import analysis step that catches issues before any files are created:
  - Detects date issues (death before birth, future dates, events before/after death)
  - Identifies relationship issues (gender/role mismatches, parent younger than child)
  - Flags orphan references to non-existent records
  - Shows data completeness issues (missing names, unknown sex, no dates)

- **Data Quality wiki page** - New comprehensive documentation covering all data quality tools, batch operations, and best practices

- **Comprehensive GEDCOM edge case test file** - New test file `gedcom-testing/gedcom-sample-medium-edge-cases.ged` with 50+ intentional data quality issues for stress testing:
  - Duplicate names without distinguishing data
  - Multiple parents claiming the same child
  - Impossible dates (death before birth, future dates, parent younger than child)
  - Sex/gender conflicts with family roles
  - Circular ancestry relationships
  - Orphan references to non-existent records
  - Special characters in names (Irish, Spanish, Chinese)
  - Date format variations (ABT, BEF, AFT, ranges, question marks like "1850?")
  - Place name variations, typos, and special characters
  - Source issues (duplicates, missing titles)
  - Family issues (empty families, multiple spouses)

- **Standardize place types modal** (Places tab) - New data quality tool to convert generic place types like "locality" to standard types (city, town, village)
  - Detects places with non-standard types from GEDCOM imports
  - Bulk actions to set all places to the same type
  - Individual type selection with one-click apply
  - Shows parent place context for better decision making

- **Place notes table open buttons** - Added separate buttons to open place notes in new tab or new window

### Changed

- **Places tab reorganization** - Reordered cards to prioritize actionable content: Data quality first, then Place notes table, then Statistics last
- **Place statistics card** - Now shows compact summary with collapsible detailed statistics (categories, top places, migration patterns)
- **Removed Referenced places card** - Consolidated into Data quality card's "Missing place notes" section to reduce redundancy

### Fixed

- **Tree output root person picker showing non-person notes** - Fixed person browser in Control Center > Tree output tab listing events, sources, and places instead of only person notes

- **Remove placeholder values treating empty/null as issues** - The batch operation now only flags actual placeholder text ("Unknown", "N/A", "???", etc.) and no longer treats null/undefined/empty properties as problems

- **Enrich place hierarchy modal preview list** - Modal now shows which places will be enriched before starting

- **Top-level places incorrectly listed as orphans** - Countries and regions without parents (Taiwan, South Korea, etc.) are no longer flagged for hierarchy enrichment

- **Duplicate place detection mismatch** - Data quality card count now matches what the merge modal actually finds

---

## [0.11.2] - 2025-12-11

  - **Bidirectional navigation**: Links between Plugin Settings and Preferences tab for easy discovery
  - **Reduced duplication**: Canvas layout and folder settings consolidated in Preferences only
  - **Default change**: `primaryTypeProperty` now defaults to `cr_type` (avoids conflicts with other plugins)

- **GEDCOM import now adds `cr_type: person`** to imported person notes for consistent note type detection

- **`cr_type` now an essential property** - Added to Guide tab documentation, "Insert essential properties" context menu action, and base template filter for consistent note detection

### Fixed

- **Family chart view only showing ancestors** - Fixed issue where the interactive family chart only displayed the direct ancestral line instead of the complete tree
  - Chart now properly shows descendants, siblings, and in-laws
  - Root cause: missing bidirectional children relationships in data transformation

- **Places tab crash with non-string place values** - Fixed TypeError when place properties contain arrays or objects instead of strings

- **GEDCOM import nested arrays for wikilinks** - Fixed YAML serialization writing `[[place]]` as nested arrays; wikilink values are now properly quoted

- **Map view not showing markers** - Fixed map not recognizing flat coordinate properties (`coordinates_lat`, `coordinates_long`) written by geocoding; now supports nested, flat, and legacy coordinate formats

- **Bidirectional relationship validation** - Fixed false positives and persistence issues
  - Now validates parent sex matches expected parent type (male → father, female → mother)
  - Prevents incorrect fixes like setting female as father_id or male as mother_id
  - Resolves issue where spouses with children in their children_id array were incorrectly flagged
  - Fixed issue where automatic bidirectional linker was reverting batch fix changes
  - Batch fix operation now suspends automatic linking during updates to prevent interference

---

## [0.11.1] - 2025-12-10

Data Quality: Enhanced batch operations with relationship validation, value normalization, and improved organization.

  - Explicitly shows which field will be modified (children_id, father_id, mother_id, spouse_id)
  - Includes context about existing relationship
  - Example: "Will add Aaron Seymour to Calvin Seymour's children_id (Aaron Seymour lists them as father)"

### Fixed

- **Remove empty/placeholder values** - Fixed false positives in preview modal

### Changed

- **GEDCOM Import: State Abbreviation Normalization**: US state abbreviations are now automatically expanded to full names during place import
  - Comma-separated: `Abbeville, SC, USA` → `Abbeville, South Carolina, USA`
  - Space-separated: `Abbeville SC` → `Abbeville, South Carolina`
  - Prevents duplicate place notes from being created during import

### Improved

- **Merge Duplicates - Pass 4**: Administrative divisions (County, Parish, etc.) are now separated from settlements before grouping
  - Prevents "Abbeville County" from being incorrectly grouped with "Abbeville" (the city)
  - Each category groups independently by base name

- **GEDCOM Import Type Inference**: Context-aware detection prevents mislabeling cities as counties

  - **Inline action buttons**: Individual "Create", "Edit", "Set parent", or "Review" buttons per issue item
  - **Batch action links**: "Find all duplicates →" and similar links connect to existing modals
  - **Other tools section**: Non-issue actions (Geocode lookup, Standardize place names, Merge duplicates) moved to dedicated section below issues
  - **Progressive disclosure**: First two issue sections expanded by default; others collapsed
  - **Priority ordering**: Missing place notes sorted by reference count (most-referenced first)

- **Places Tab Workflow Order**: Reorganized Data Quality card to present tools in recommended workflow order
  1. Missing place notes → Create missing places
  2. Real places missing coordinates → Bulk geocode
  3. Orphan places → Enrich hierarchy (new)
  4. Duplicate names → Merge duplicates
  5. Name variations → Standardize names (moved from Other Tools)

  - Detects place notes with identical names that may represent the same location
  - Suggests the most complete note as canonical (based on parent, coordinates, type, references)
  - Merging updates person notes, re-parents child places, and moves duplicates to trash
  - Accessible via Places tab workflow (step 2) or command palette
  - Particularly useful after GEDCOM import when duplicates are common

- **Full Name Similarity Detection**: Duplicate detection now also groups places by normalized `full_name`
  - Catches duplicates like "Hartford, CT" and "Hartford, CT, USA" with different parents
  - Normalizes full names by removing common country suffixes (USA, United Kingdom, etc.)
  - Shows "similar full name" match reason in the UI

---

## [0.10.10] - 2025-12-07

### Fixed

- **Place Hierarchy Not Loading from GEDCOM Import**: Fixed parent-child relationships not being resolved for GEDCOM-imported places
  - Root cause: GEDCOM importer writes `parent: "[[ParentName]]"` but PlaceGraphService only checked `parent_place` and `parent_place_id`
  - Now supports `parent`, `parent_place`, and `parent_place_id` properties
