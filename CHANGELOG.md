## [0.2.1-beta] - 2025-11-23

### Fixed

- **Person picker date display**: Fixed person picker and tree generation interface to properly display birth/death dates instead of `cr_id` values. The UI now shows meaningful date information (e.g., "b. 1888" or "1888 – 1952") when available, with `cr_id` as fallback only when dates are missing.
  - Resolved issue where Obsidian's YAML parser converts `born`/`died` date strings to JavaScript Date objects, which weren't being converted back to strings for display
  - Updated person picker modal, Control Center tree generation tab, and root person display
  - Affects both context menu "Generate tree" and Control Center inline person browser

- **Excalidraw export compatibility**: Fixed Excalidraw export feature to generate valid, properly formatted Excalidraw files. Exported family trees now display correctly in Excalidraw with all nodes and connections visible.
  - Corrected opacity values from 0-1 scale to proper 0-100 scale
  - Added missing required fields: `frameId`, `rawText`, `autoResize`, `lineHeight`, `elbowed`
  - Fixed Drawing section JSON structure to be properly enclosed in `%%` comment blocks
  - Added block reference IDs to text elements for proper Excalidraw indexing
  - Implemented coordinate normalization to handle Canvas negative coordinates
