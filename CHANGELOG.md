## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **DNA match tracking** ([#126](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/126)): Opt-in DNA match tracking for genetic genealogy workflows. Enable via Settings → Advanced → DNA tracking:
  - **DNA Match person type**: Select "DNA Match" when creating persons to mark them as genetic matches
  - **DNA Information fields**: Track shared cM, testing company, kit ID, match type (BKM/BMM/confirmed/unconfirmed), endogamy flag, and notes in Edit Person modal
  - **DNA Match relationship**: New `dna_match` relationship type with bidirectional syncing (adding A→B automatically creates B→A)
  - **DNA badge in person picker**: Shows flask icon and shared cM value for DNA matches
  - All DNA features are invisible when setting is disabled (default: OFF)

- **Repair missing relationship IDs** ([#197](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/197)): New batch operation in Control Center → Data Quality to populate missing `_id` fields from resolvable wikilinks. This improves relationship reliability when notes are renamed:
  - Detects wikilinks without corresponding `_id` fields (e.g., `father` without `father_id`)
  - Resolves wikilinks to their `cr_id` values using the person index
  - Preview shows all repairs with warnings for unresolvable wikilinks (broken links, ambiguous targets, or targets missing cr_id)
  - Supports both single-value and array fields (e.g., `children`, `spouse`)

### Fixed

- **Legacy command IDs not working**: Fixed UI buttons in Control Center tabs (People, Places, Events, Organizations, Sources) that were still using the old `canvas-roots:` command prefix instead of `charted-roots:`, causing "Create base" and similar actions to fail silently.

---

## [0.19.8] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed

- **Name components not saving in Edit Person modal** ([#174](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/174)): Name component fields (given name, surnames, maiden name, married names) were not being written to frontmatter when editing existing person notes. The fields displayed correctly when reading but changes were not persisted.

- **GEDCOM import freezing on large imports** ([#193](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/193)): Added periodic event loop yielding during all import phases (sources, notes, people, relationships, events) to prevent UI freezing. Also added safety limits (max 1000 iterations) to duplicate filename detection loops and optimized place cache building to only scan the places folder instead of all vault files.

- **Source linking via Edit Person uses wrong folder** ([#196](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/196)): When linking a source via Edit Person modal, the wikilink now uses the file's basename instead of the frontmatter title. Previously, if the filename differed from the title, clicking the link would create a new file in the vault root instead of opening the existing source.

---

## [0.19.7] - 2026-01-13

### Added

- **Name components support** ([#174](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/174), [#192](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/192)): Explicit name component properties in frontmatter for multi-surname cultures and maiden/married name tracking:
  - `given_name`: First/given name(s) - populated from GEDCOM GIVN tag
  - `surnames`: Array of surnames - supports Hispanic, Portuguese, and other multi-surname naming conventions
  - `maiden_name`: Birth surname (already existed with aliases)
  - `married_names`: Array of married surnames - supports multiple marriages
  - Statistics Top Surnames now counts all surnames in the array
  - Split Wizard matches against all surname variants (maiden name, married names, explicit surnames)
  - GEDCOM import writes `given_name` and `surnames` from GIVN/SURN tags
  - GEDCOM export writes name components to GIVN/SURN tags
  - Create/Edit Person modal includes fields for all name components

### Fixed

- **Family chart shows wrong person when root is filtered** ([#191](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/191)): When opening a family chart for a person excluded by the folder filter, the chart now shows a helpful notice instead of silently displaying an unrelated entity.

---

## [0.19.6] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- **Per-map place filtering** ([#153](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/153)): Places can now be restricted to specific custom maps within the same universe. Add a `maps` property to place notes with an array of map IDs to control which maps the place appears on. Places without a `maps` property continue to appear on all maps in their universe (backward compatible). The Create/Edit Place modal includes a "Restrict to maps" section with checkboxes for available maps. When creating a place by right-clicking on a custom map, the current map is auto-selected.

### Fixed

- **Map view not opening from Control Center** ([#188](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/188)): Fixed command ID prefix in Control Center that prevented the map view from opening when clicked.

- **Duplicate nodes in canvas trees with pedigree collapse** ([#186](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/186)): Persons appearing in multiple ancestry paths (e.g., when siblings marry into the same family) now display as a single node with edges from both paths converging to it.

- **Custom relationship edge colors on canvas trees** ([#185](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/185)): Custom relationships that map to standard family tree connections (e.g., a "Godparent" relationship mapped to Parent) now display with their configured color and line style on canvas trees. Previously these relationships appeared correctly but used the default parent or spouse edge color instead of the custom color.

---

## [0.19.5] - 2026-01-12

### Added

- **GEDCOM notes import** ([#179](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/179)): GEDCOM NOTE tags attached to individuals are now imported and appended to person notes. Features include:
  - Inline notes (text directly in NOTE tag)
  - Multi-line notes with CONT/CONC continuation
  - Referenced notes (shared NOTE records via @N001@ references)
  - Optional import toggle in import wizard (Step 3 → Entity types → Notes)
  - Notes appear in "## Notes" section with "### GEDCOM note" headers
  - Optional "Create separate note files" toggle creates individual note entity files instead of embedding content, matching Gramps importer behavior

- **Large import mode** ([#180](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/180)): New toggle in import wizard (Step 3 → Performance) that suspends relationship syncing during import to prevent file system timeouts on large imports (500+ people). Shows notices when activated and when import completes.

### Changed

- **Flat membership format** ([#181](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/181)): Organization memberships now use parallel arrays (`membership_orgs`, `membership_org_ids`, `membership_roles`, `membership_from_dates`, `membership_to_dates`, `membership_notes`) instead of nested objects. This improves compatibility with Obsidian's Properties editor and Dataview queries. Legacy formats are still read but new memberships save in the flat format. A Data Quality check and bulk migration action are available for converting existing notes.

### Fixed

- **Membership YAML array formatting**: Fixed YAML serialization for organization memberships where the hyphen appeared on a separate line from the first property. Now produces standard YAML format with the first property on the same line as the hyphen.

- **Edit Organisation overwrites frontmatter** ([#182](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/182)): The Edit Organisation modal now preserves existing frontmatter properties instead of overwriting them. Previously, any custom properties added to organisation notes would be lost when editing.

### Enhanced

- **Timeline description display for all event types** ([#157](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/157)): Timeline now shows event descriptions for all event types (census, custom, occupation, residence, etc.) when a description exists, instead of showing the generic event title. For example, a census event displays "Census: 1850 Federal Census" instead of "Census of John Smith". Birth and death events continue to show the full title with the person's name since that's more meaningful for those life events. Related: [#183](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/183) for birth event role filtering.

---

## [0.19.4] - 2026-01-11

### Changed

- **Settings consolidated to Plugin Settings** ([#176](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/176)): All settings have been moved from Control Center → Preferences to the standard Obsidian plugin settings location (Settings → Charted Roots). The Preferences tab has been removed from Control Center. Settings are now organized into 9 sections: Folders, Data & detection, Canvas & trees, Privacy & export, Dates & validation, Sex & gender, Places, Property & value aliases, and Advanced.

- **Statistics Dashboard reorganization**: The "Visual Trees" tab has been renamed to "Trees & reports" and now consolidates all output generation. Both "Generate Reports" (markdown reports) and "Visual Trees" (PDF tree exports) have been moved from Statistics to this tab. The Statistics view is now purely analytical, addressing user feedback that action wizards felt out of place among statistics.

### Added

- **Romantic relationship label preference** ([#167](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/167)): New setting lets users choose between "Spouse" or "Partner" terminology throughout the UI. Located in Settings → Charted Roots → Sex & gender. This is a display preference only — frontmatter property names remain unchanged.

- **Edit current note command**: New command "Edit current note" opens the appropriate edit modal (person, place, or event) for the active note. Assign a hotkey in Settings → Hotkeys to quickly edit notes without navigating through the file menu. Reduces the friction of: 3-dot menu → Charted Roots → Edit.

### Fixed

- **Gramps import place hierarchy** ([#178](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/178)): Gramps imports now create the full place hierarchy (country, state, county, city) just like GEDCOM imports. Previously only the leaf places were created. Parent places are now linked via `parent_place` and `parent_place_id` properties.

- **Custom relationship family tree integration**: The "Include on family trees" toggle for custom relationship types now works for all mapping options. Previously only "Parent" and "Step-parent" mappings were implemented. Now "Foster parent", "Adoptive parent", "Guardian", "Spouse", and "Child" mappings all properly add people to generated trees.

---

## [0.19.3] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- **Category-based place organization** ([#163](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/163)): Places can now be automatically organized into category-based subfolders (e.g., `Places/Historical/`, `Places/Fictional/`). Enable in Settings → Preferences → "Use category-based subfolders". Features include:
  - **Automatic folder routing**: New places are stored in category-appropriate subfolders
  - **Edit with move prompt**: When changing a place's category, you're prompted to move the file
  - **Custom folder overrides**: Define custom subfolder paths for specific categories
  - **Data Quality check**: Detects places in wrong folders with bulk "Organize places" action
  - **Bulk migration modal**: Move multiple misplaced places at once

- **Timeline event description display** ([#157](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/157)): For descriptive event types (occupation, residence, military, education), timelines now show "Type: description" instead of the generic title. Example: "1850 — Occupation: Farmer" instead of "Occupation of John Smith". This makes timeline entries more informative at a glance.

- **External ID preservation for import round-trip** ([#175](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/175)): GEDCOM and Gramps imports now store the original source ID (`external_id`) and source type (`external_id_source`) in frontmatter. When exporting back to GEDCOM, original xref IDs (e.g., `@I0001@`) are preserved, enabling cleaner round-trip workflows with other genealogy software.

---

## [0.19.2] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed

- **GEDCOM import preserves partial date precision** ([#172](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/172)): GEDCOM dates now preserve their original precision instead of being normalized to full ISO format. Year-only dates (`1850`) stay as `1850` instead of becoming `1850-01-01`. Month+year dates (`MAR 1855`) become `1855-03` instead of `1855-03-01`. Date qualifiers (`ABT`, `BEF`, `AFT`, `CAL`, `EST`) and ranges (`BET 1882 AND 1885`) are now preserved. This maintains source fidelity and prevents false precision in genealogical data.

### Enhanced

- **User-friendly date display formatting** ([#172](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/172)): Qualified dates are now prettified throughout the UI. `ABT 1878` displays as "c. 1878", `BEF 1950` as "before 1950", `AFT 1880` as "after 1880", and `BET 1882 AND 1885` as "1882–1885". ISO partial dates like `1855-03` display as "Mar 1855". This formatting applies to person tables, person picker, timelines, tree previews, and visual tree exports.

- **Export round-trip for partial dates** ([#172](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/172)): GEDCOM, Gramps, and GedcomX exporters now correctly handle partial dates and qualifiers. Dates like `ABT 1878` or `BET 1882 AND 1885` export in each format's expected structure, ensuring data round-trips cleanly without losing precision.

---

## [0.19.1] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed

- **MyHeritage GEDCOM whitespace-only line handling** ([#144](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/144)): Fixed preprocessing of MyHeritage GEDCOM files where tab-only lines between continuation fragments caused parse errors. Whitespace-only lines are now skipped entirely, allowing subsequent continuation content to be properly appended to the previous valid GEDCOM line.

### Enhanced

- **Async GEDCOM parsing for large files** ([#144](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/144)): Added async versions of GEDCOM parsing functions (`parseAsync`, `parseContentAsync`, `analyzeFileAsync`) that yield to the event loop periodically. This prevents UI freezing when importing large MyHeritage files (800KB+, 40K+ lines). The import wizard now uses async parsing with progress callbacks.

- **GEDCOM anonymization script**: Improved `tools/anonymize_gedcom.py` to explicitly strip BOM characters and warn about malformed early lines. Updated documentation to clarify that `0 HEAD` and `0 TRLR` records are preserved.

---

## [0.19.0] - 2026-01-09

### Changed

- **Plugin renamed from Canvas Roots to Charted Roots** ([#141](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/141)): The plugin has been renamed to better reflect its broader genealogical visualization capabilities beyond Obsidian Canvas. The new name encompasses the Interactive Family Chart, Map View, Statistics Dashboard, PDF exports, and canvas tree generation.

### Added

- **Automatic vault migration**: On first load, the plugin automatically migrates existing vault data:
  - Canvas metadata: `plugin: 'canvas-roots'` → `plugin: 'charted-roots'`
  - Code blocks: `canvas-roots-timeline`, `canvas-roots-relationships`, `canvas-roots-media` → `charted-roots-*`
- **Backward compatibility**: Old protocol handlers (`canvas-roots-map`, `canvas-roots-timeline`) and command IDs continue to work via dual-registration

### Migration

- **BRAT users**: Update your BRAT configuration to use `banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots` instead of `banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots`
- **Manual install users**: The plugin folder can remain as `canvas-roots` or be renamed to `charted-roots`
- **Settings**: All settings are preserved automatically

---

## [0.18.32] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- **Automatic wikilink resolution** ([#104](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/104)): Wikilinks in relationship fields now automatically resolve to `cr_id` values. You can write `father: "[[John Smith]]"` without needing a separate `father_id` field — the plugin resolves the wikilink to the person's `cr_id` at graph-building time. Explicit `_id` fields still take precedence when present. If multiple person notes share the same basename (e.g., two "John Smith.md" files), resolution returns null and the ambiguity is surfaced in the Data Quality report.

- **Wikidata Place Web Clipper template** ([#166](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/166)): Added AI-powered Web Clipper template for extracting place data from Wikidata. Auto-triggers on Wikidata Q-pages and extracts coordinates, place type, parent place, alternate names, administrative hierarchy, and Wikipedia links. Works seamlessly with enhanced staging promotion workflow.

### Enhanced

- **Staging promotion workflow** ([#165](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/165)): Enhanced the promotion process to automatically assign `cr_id` to notes missing it, route notes to correct folders based on type (places to Places folder, events to Events folder, etc.), and remove clipper metadata on promotion. This ensures Web Clipper notes (like Wikidata places) are fully functional in Charted Roots immediately after promotion.

- **PersonIndexService integration** ([#104](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/104)): RelationshipValidator and ProofSummaryService now use the centralized PersonIndexService for cr_id lookups, eliminating duplicate vault scanning and improving performance.

---

## [0.18.31] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- **GEDCOM anonymization tool**: Added `tools/anonymize_gedcom.py` script to help users create shareable test files when reporting GEDCOM import issues without exposing sensitive genealogical data. The script anonymizes names, places, dates, notes, and contact information while preserving GEDCOM structure and relationships for debugging. Supports `--keep-dates` and `--keep-places` flags for targeted debugging scenarios. See [Troubleshooting wiki](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/wiki/Troubleshooting#sharing-gedcom-files-for-debugging) for usage instructions.

### Fixed

- **Find a Grave Web Clipper templates** ([#155](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/155)): Fixed URL trigger pattern to include HTTPS protocol for auto-selection. Fixed person name extraction to use `.bio-name` CSS selector instead of page title, removing unwanted "Grave - " prefix. Removed hardcoded path configuration to allow user customization.
- **Gramps event names include all participants** ([#156](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/156)): Fixed Gramps import creating event titles with all participants instead of just the principal person. Event names were joining all participants with "and" (e.g., "Birth of Baby and Mother"). Now filters for participants with role="Primary", falling back to the first participant if no role is assigned. The frontmatter `persons` field still lists all participants for reference.
- **Create Place modal missing parent dropdown from Dashboard** ([#158](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/158)): Fixed inconsistent UI in Create Place modal depending on entry point. When opened from Dashboard, the parent place dropdown was missing and showed only a text input. Now passes the required place graph services to enable the dropdown in both Dashboard and Places tab.
- **Dynamic blocks fail with 'value.startsWith is not a function' error** ([#160](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/160)): Fixed timeline and relationships dynamic blocks crashing when config values contain commas inside wikilinks. The config parser was splitting all comma-containing values into arrays, breaking values like `[[Person Name|Alias]]` or `[[Place, City]]`. Now only splits on commas outside wikilink brackets.
- **Import Wizard Preview stuck on 'Parsing file...'** ([#161](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/161)): Fixed Preview step getting stuck showing "Parsing file..." indefinitely. The `isParsing` flag was being cleared in the finally block after the UI re-render, causing the render to always see the loading state. Moved the flag reset before the render call so the parsed counts display properly.
- **Create Place modal doesn't recognize existing parent places** ([#162](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/162)): Fixed modal prompting to create duplicate parent places even when they already exist. Two scenarios were broken: (1) When typing a parent name that exists as a grandparent, the stale place graph cache didn't reflect the newly created intermediate place, causing it to miss existing grandparents. Now reloads the cache before opening each parent modal. (2) When selecting an existing parent from the dropdown, the modal still prompted for creation because `pendingParentPlace` wasn't cleared. Now clears the pending parent flag in all dropdown selection cases.

### Documentation

- **Web Clipper Integration wiki**: Added section documenting potential future place templates (Wikidata, GOV) and clarifying which place sources are better suited for Web Clipper templates vs native plugin integration. Related to [#128](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/128).
- **Unified Place Lookup planning document**: Created comprehensive planning document (`docs/planning/unified-place-lookup.md`) for native multi-source place lookup feature with detailed TypeScript implementation examples for PlaceLookupService, PlaceLookupModal, and integration with Create Place modal. Covers FamilySearch Places API, Wikidata, GeoNames, GOV, and Nominatim with automatic parent place hierarchy creation.
- **Place Data Sources research document**: Added reference document (`docs/research/place-data-sources.md`) comparing 5 genealogical place databases with API endpoints, authentication requirements, rate limits, use case recommendations for different research scenarios, and implementation priority guidance.

---

## [0.18.30] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- **Ambiguous wikilink detection in Data Quality** ([#104](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/104)): The Data Quality report now detects when wikilinks in relationship fields (father, mother, spouse, children, etc.) match multiple files with the same basename. When multiple person notes share the same name (e.g., two "John Smith.md" files in different folders), wikilink references become ambiguous and cannot be resolved. The new check generates warnings (code: `AMBIGUOUS_WIKILINK`, category: relationship_inconsistency) suggesting users add `_id` fields (e.g., `father_id`) to disambiguate. This is part of Phase 3 of the wikilink-to-cr_id resolution implementation.

### Fixed

- **Infinite preprocessing loop in GEDCOM import** ([#144](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/144)): Fixed infinite loop causing repeated preprocessing during GEDCOM import. The import wizard Step 4 (Preview) was triggering concurrent calls to parseFileForPreview() because renders occurred while async parsing was still in progress. Added isParsing guard flag to prevent concurrent parsing attempts.

---

## [0.18.29] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed

- **Import wizard toggles can't be re-enabled** ([#154](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/154)): Fixed bug where entity type toggles (People, Places, Sources, Events, etc.) in the import wizard couldn't be turned back on after being toggled off. The click handler captured the initial value in a closure instead of reading the current DOM state.
- **MyHeritage GEDCOM preprocessing creates invalid lines** ([#144](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/144)): Fixed "Invalid GEDCOM line format" parse error when importing large MyHeritage files. The preprocessor was converting `<br>` tags to actual newlines, which created lines without level numbers. Changed to replace `<br>` with spaces instead.

---

## [0.18.28] - 2026-01-07

### Added

- **MyHeritage GEDCOM compatibility** ([#144](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/144)): Automatically detect and fix MyHeritage GEDCOM export issues during import. MyHeritage exports contain UTF-8 BOM, double-encoded HTML entities (`&amp;lt;` instead of `<`), and `<br>` tags that prevent parsing. New preprocessing automatically detects MyHeritage files (via `1 SOUR MYHERITAGE` tag) and applies fixes. Three modes available in Settings → Import/Export: Auto (default, detect and fix), MyHeritage (always fix), None (disabled). Import results modal shows what was fixed.

### Fixed

- **Special character sanitization for all importers** ([#139](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/139)): Extended relationship name sanitization to Gramps, CSV, and GedcomX importers. Previously only the GEDCOM importer sanitized names containing special characters like `"`, `()`, `[]`, `{}`. Now all importers use a shared `sanitizeName()` utility to ensure wikilinks in relationship fields (father, mother, spouse, stepparents, adoptive parents, children) match sanitized filenames, preventing "linked to person who doesn't exist" warnings.
- **Duplicate person filenames during batch import**: Fixed "File already exists" errors when importing multiple people with identical names (e.g., multiple "Son (stillborn)" entries). The vault index doesn't update fast enough between sequential file creations, causing race conditions. Solution: Track created paths in a Set and add retry logic with counter increment, matching the existing approach used for event notes.
- **Map view "Link existing place" crash** ([#151](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/151)): Fixed error "createFolderFilterService is not a function" when using right-click → "Link existing place here" on maps. The code was calling non-existent factory methods on the plugin object. Solution: Import and instantiate `FolderFilterService` and `PlaceGraphService` directly.
- **Edit Place modal styling issues**: Fixed truncated labels (e.g., "Parent place" showing as "P...") and horizontal scrollbar in the Edit Place modal. Added CSS to prevent setting-item labels from shrinking and constrained dropdown widths.

---

## [0.18.27] - 2026-01-07

### Added

- **DMS coordinate format support** ([#121](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/121)): Opt-in DMS (degrees, minutes, seconds) parsing for coordinate input in the place creation modal. When enabled via Settings → Data & detection → "Accept DMS coordinate format", users can enter coordinates like `33°51'08"N` or `33 51 08 N` and they automatically convert to decimal degrees. Supports symbol notation, space-separated, hyphen-separated, and direction prefix formats.
- **Create place context menu for folders** ([#152](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/152)): Added "Create place" option to right-click context menu when clicking on the Places folder or any subfolder within it. Opens the Create Place modal with the target folder pre-selected as destination.
- **Link existing place to map location** ([#151](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/151)): Added "Link existing place here" option to map right-click context menu. Opens a place picker to select an existing place note and updates its coordinates to the clicked location, then refreshes the map to show the marker.
- **Optional person names** ([#140](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/140)): The name field is now optional when creating person notes, allowing placeholder persons to be created and filled in later. Useful for genealogy research where relationships are known before identities (e.g., "John's father" before learning his name). Unnamed persons display as "Unnamed" in the UI and trigger a data quality warning.
- **DNA match tracking - Phase 1** ([#126](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/126)): Lightweight DNA match tracking for genetic genealogy workflows. Phase 1 adds documentation and templates only—no code changes required to core functionality. Includes: DNA match template snippet in the template snippets modal (with fields for shared cM, testing company, kit ID, match type, endogamy flag, and notes); "DNA Matches" view in the People Bases template (filters by dna_shared_cm, sorts by highest matches first); documented frontmatter properties (dna_shared_cm, dna_testing_company, dna_kit_id, dna_match_type, dna_endogamy_flag, dna_notes) for manual use.

### Fixed

- **Event edit modal deletes custom frontmatter properties** ([#150](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/150)): Fixed editing events through the context menu deleting custom properties added via Templater or manually. The edit modal was rebuilding frontmatter from scratch, only preserving known properties. Solution: Switched to Obsidian's `processFrontMatter` API which safely updates only managed properties while preserving all others.
- **BCE date sorting in dynamic timeline blocks** ([#146](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/146)): Fixed events spanning BCE/AD boundary sorting incorrectly in timeline codeblocks. The `extractYear` method only matched positive years, so "11 BCE" was extracted as "11" instead of "-11", causing it to appear after "14 AD". Now properly handles BCE/BC suffix, ISO negative years, and AD/CE suffix formats.

---

## [0.18.26] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed

- **BCE/AD date sorting in timelines** ([#146](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/146)): Fixed incorrect chronological ordering of events spanning the BCE/AD boundary. Events with BCE dates (e.g., "11 BCE") now properly sort before AD dates (e.g., "14 AD"). Root cause: sort-order-service.ts used lexicographic string comparison which doesn't handle negative years correctly. Solution: Added compareDates() helper that extracts years numerically for proper chronological ordering.
- **Timeline place text whitespace collapse** ([#146](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/146)): Fixed missing space between event title and place in dynamic timeline blocks. Browser was collapsing whitespace when MarkdownRenderer created block-level elements for wikilinks, causing "Marriage of Person Ain Place" instead of "Marriage of Person A in Place". Solution: Added non-breaking space (`\u00A0`) before "in" text to prevent whitespace collapse.
- **Wikilink resolution for names with special characters** ([#139](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/139)): Fixed wikilink references breaking for relationship names containing quotes and other special characters. When importing from GEDCOM, filenames were sanitized to remove characters like `"()[]{}`, but relationship fields (father, mother, spouse, children, step-parents, adoptive parents) still contained the original unsanitized names. This caused wikilink mismatches where `[[Jane "Jennie" Smith]]` couldn't resolve to file `Jane Jennie Smith.md`. Solution: Extracted sanitization logic into dedicated `sanitizeName()` method and applied it consistently to all relationship name fields during import, ensuring wikilinks match actual filenames.
- **Pedigree chart PDF export artifacts** ([#148](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/148)): Fixed raw markdown code block delimiters (` ``` `) appearing in PDF exports of pedigree charts. The fenced code blocks were used to preserve ASCII tree formatting in markdown but rendered as visible backticks in PDF output. Solution: Removed code block markers since Unicode box-drawing characters render properly without them in both markdown and PDF formats.
- **Unicode box-drawing characters invisible in PDF exports** ([#148](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/148)): Fixed pedigree tree connectors (├──, └──, │) rendering as blank spaces in PDF exports while displaying correctly in markdown. Root cause: pdfmake doesn't properly handle Unicode glyphs missing from embedded fonts. Solution: Switched from RobotoMono to DejaVu Sans Mono fonts which provide comprehensive Unicode coverage including box-drawing characters. Added build-fonts.js script to bundle fonts into pdfmake's virtual file system.
- **Staging manager shows incorrect entity count** ([#149](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/149)): Fixed "All" filter showing 0 total entities when clipped notes are present in staging. Root cause: staging-service.ts was missing `entityCounts.other` from the total calculation, so clipped notes (categorized as "other" type) weren't being counted. Solution: Added `entityCounts.other` to totalEntities calculation. Also removed confusing "Import Batches" terminology from UI and improved entity type breakdown visual alignment.

## [0.18.25] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- **Web Clipper Integration - Phase 1** ([#128](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/128)):
  - Auto-detect clipped notes in staging folder (files with `clip_source_type`, `clipped_from`, or `clipped_date` properties)
  - Unified Dashboard "Staging" card shows breakdown: "3 clips (1 new), 1 other"
  - Toggle buttons in Staging Manager: [All] [Clipped] [Other] for filtering staging content
  - Multi-level filtering: stats, batches, and files filtered based on clipper metadata
  - Unread clip count resets when Staging Manager opens
  - Works with any user-created Web Clipper templates
  - Comprehensive wiki documentation with setup guide, template examples, workflow instructions, and troubleshooting

### Fixed

- Timeline event location spacing: fixed missing space between event links and location text (e.g., "Murder of Agrippina in Baiae")
- **Filename sanitization for special characters** ([#139](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/139)): Strip parentheses and brackets from filenames to prevent wikilink errors (e.g., `Susan (Sue)` → `Susan Sue.md`). Fallback to `Unknown.md` when sanitization results in empty string

---

## [0.18.24] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- **Staging Management UI** ([#137](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/137)):
  - New dedicated modal for managing staged imports with batch organization
  - View staging folder statistics: total files, batches, and potential duplicates
  - Expandable batch cards showing entity breakdown (people, places, sources, events, organizations)
  - Click batch headers to preview individual files before promoting
  - Per-batch actions: Check duplicates, Promote to main tree, Delete batch
  - Bulk actions: Promote all, Delete all staging data
  - Cross-import duplicate detection using name similarity (Levenshtein), date proximity, and gender matching
  - Access via Dashboard (yellow indicator when staging has data), Command palette, or Import Wizard success screen

### Changed

- **Staging settings consolidation**:
  - Moved "Staging isolation" toggle from Data settings to Preferences section
  - Renamed "Staging folder" setting label for clarity
- Removed Staging Area from Control Center Tools section navigation (still accessible via Dashboard, Command palette, and Import Wizard)

### Fixed

- **Event edit modal loses person link on save** ([#135](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/135)):
  - Fixed bug where editing an event would silently remove the person link
  - The modal only checked the legacy `person:` property but events are now created with `persons:` array
  - Now properly loads person from `persons[0]` first, then falls back to `person` for compatibility

---

## [0.18.23] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- **Auto-exclude template folders from note discovery** ([#136](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/136)):
  - Automatically detects and excludes template folders configured in core Templates, Templater, and QuickAdd plugins
  - Template files (containing Templater syntax like `<% tp.file.title %>`) no longer appear in person/place/event lists
  - New settings in Advanced section: toggle for auto-detection, info box showing detected folders, text area for additional folders
  - Changed built-in Templater snippets to leave `cr_id` empty (Charted Roots auto-generates when notes are indexed)

### Fixed

- **Gramps import hangs during gzip decompression** ([#134](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/134)):
  - Fixed .gpkg and .gramps file imports hanging indefinitely when decompressing gzip data
  - Added 30-second timeout to `DecompressionStream` operations to prevent indefinite hanging
  - Changed .gramps file handling to use proper decompression utility instead of raw text read
  - Improved logging with progress details for decompression operations

---

## [0.18.22] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- **Privacy-aware canvas generation** ([#102](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/102)):
  - New privacy options in Tree Wizard for canvas and Excalidraw generation
  - Living persons can be obfuscated with text nodes showing "Living", "Private", or initials
  - Text nodes include wikilink for navigation to the person's note
  - Choose between 'text' format (no file link) or 'file' format (keeps clickable link)
  - Preview step shows count of privacy-protected persons (e.g., "42 people · 5 privacy-protected")
  - Option follows global privacy setting by default, can be overridden per-generation
  - Supports 'hidden' privacy setting to completely exclude living persons from canvas

### Fixed

- **Adoptive relationships: duplicate nodes and missing children in family chart** ([#129](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/129)):
  - Adopted children now appear when viewing family chart from adoptive parent's perspective
  - Fixed duplicate parent nodes when both `adoptive_parent` and `adopted_child` are set
  - Added bidirectional sync: `adopted_child` on parent now syncs to `adoptive_parent` on child
  - Descendant tree views now include adopted children

- **Gramps XML import hangs at "Parsing file..."** ([#130](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/130)):
  - Fixed async/await bug in gzip decompression that caused the import wizard to hang indefinitely
  - The decompression stream writer operations were not being awaited, preventing the reader from completing

- **GEDCOM import: wikilinks point to wrong person when names are duplicated** ([#132](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/132)):
  - When multiple people share the same name (e.g., father and child both named "George Hall"), wikilinks now correctly point to the right person's file
  - Previously, global string replacement caused all `[[George Hall]]` references to point to the same file
  - Now uses cr_id-targeted replacement to match each wikilink with its corresponding `_id` field

- **Gramps import: wikilinks point to wrong person when names are duplicated** ([#133](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/133)):
  - Same fix as #132 applied to the Gramps XML importer
  - Affects .gramps and .gpkg file imports

---

## [0.18.21] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- **Private fields support** ([#98](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/98)):
  - New `private_fields` frontmatter property to mark specific fields as private
  - Fields listed in `private_fields` will be excluded from exports (with user confirmation)
  - Common use cases: protecting deadnames (`previous_names`), medical notes, legal information
  - Added utility functions for private field filtering in export contexts

- **Export warnings for private fields** ([#99](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/99)):
  - Warning modal shown before export when private fields are detected
  - Displays which fields are marked private and how many people have them
  - Users can choose to include, exclude, or cancel the export
  - Supports deadname protection via `previous_names` + `private_fields` pattern

- **Privacy feature discoverability** ([#100](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/100)):
  - First-run notice shown after importing data when living persons are detected and privacy protection is disabled
  - Users can configure privacy settings, dismiss permanently, or be reminded later
  - Export wizard preview now shows info notice when privacy is disabled and living persons will be exported
  - Both notices link directly to privacy configuration settings

### Fixed

- **Control Center and person picker freezes on large vaults** ([#113](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/113)):
  - Clicking names in Control Center or using Add Father/Mother/etc. caused 30+ second freezes on macOS with large vaults
  - Added caching for graph services at the modal level to avoid expensive recomputation on every click
  - PersonPickerModal now uses plugin's graph service when available, avoiding redundant cache loading
  - Graph data is computed once and reused, with cache invalidation when data changes

- **Relationship calculator asymmetry with unresolved Gramps handles** ([#109](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/109)):
  - Root cause 1: When a referenced person doesn't exist in the Gramps data (e.g., ancestors not in database), the import left Gramps handles (e.g., `_PTHMF88SXO93W8QTDJ`) in `_id` fields instead of cr_ids
  - Root cause 2: When multiple people have the same name, the import's relationship update pass was reading the wrong file due to filename collisions
  - Added cleanup step in Gramps import to remove unresolved handles from `_id` fields after the cr_id replacement pass
  - Changed file lookup to use `findPersonByCrId()` instead of name-derived filenames
  - Also added defensive filtering in family graph to handle existing data with unresolved handles

---

## [0.18.20] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- **Timeline block missing space before place name** - Fixed whitespace collapsing in dynamic timeline display ([#122](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/122)):
  - Changed place text from separate text node to leading space in span content
  - Fixes "Residencein" appearing instead of "Residence in"

- **Dashboard "data issues" count links to wrong destination** ([#115](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/115), part of [#114](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/114)):
  - Dashboard now shows the same issue count as Statistics Dashboard
  - Changed dashboard to calculate total issues as: missing birth dates + orphaned people + unsourced events
  - Added `unsourcedEvents` to VaultStatsService for efficient counting

- **Statistics Dashboard total doesn't match visible category sums** ([#116](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/116), part of [#114](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/114)):
  - Clarified what the "Issues" total represents
  - Changed subtitle from "Items needing attention" to "Missing births + orphans + unsourced events"

- **Data Quality checker flags `male`/`female` as non-standard sex format** ([#117](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/117), part of [#114](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/114)):
  - Now accepts common synonyms (male/female) in addition to GEDCOM codes (M/F/X/U)
  - Uses existing value alias system for consistent synonym handling

- **"Living people" calculation is inaccurate for historical genealogy data** ([#118](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/118), part of [#114](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/114)):
  - Living person count now uses `livingPersonAgeThreshold` setting (default 100 years)
  - Only counts people as "potentially living" if birth year is within threshold and no death date

- **Gramps import creates invalid cr_id formats** ([#119](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/119), part of [#114](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/114)):
  - Fixed cr_id replacement in second pass to respect property aliases
  - Now `father_id`, `mother_id`, `spouse_id`, `children_id`, and other relationship fields are correctly updated

### Added

- **Distinguish actionable errors from informational data gaps** ([#120](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/120), part of [#114](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/114)):
  - Data quality section now groups issues by severity
  - **Errors** (red): Date inconsistencies and other fixable problems

---

## [0.18.19] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- **Relationship calculator not traversing gender-neutral parents** - BFS pathfinding now correctly traverses `parents`/`parents_id` relationships ([#109](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/109)):
  - Added traversal of `parentCrIds` in relationship calculator so paths can go "up" through gender-neutral parents
  - Added reverse child inference from `parentCrIds` in family graph cache so parents using gender-neutral fields have `childrenCrIds` populated
  - Added debug logging to help diagnose asymmetric relationship calculation issues

- **New child notes created with obsolete `child` property** - Fixed legacy property name usage ([#110](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/110)):
  - Removed automatic addition of empty `child` property when creating new person notes
  - Updated relationship-history, data-quality, and base-template to use normalized `children` property
  - Read operations still support legacy `child` property for backward compatibility

- **Import completion screen shows wrong entity counts** - Fixed completion screen to show actual imported counts ([#111](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/111)):
  - Completion screen now shows counts from import results instead of file preview counts
  - Entity types not selected for import no longer appear in the summary

- **Family Tree canvas separates spouses when grouping siblings** - Spouses now stay adjacent when siblings are grouped by parent pair ([#103](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/103)):
  - In-laws are now attached to their blood-relative spouse's parent-pair group
  - Prevents spouses from being "captured" into different sibling groups

- **Custom Relationship uses `parent` instead of `parents` and Family Tree only shows one parent when mixing property types** - Fixed gender-neutral parent property handling ([#112](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/112)):
  - Changed built-in relationship type IDs from `parent`/`child` to `parents`/`children` so Custom Relationship writes to correct properties
  - Family Tree view now shows all parents when mixing `father`/`mother` with `parents` property (up to 2 total)
  - Children are now correctly recognized as belonging to a parent using `parentCrIds` even when biological parents exist

- **Person picker search may not work on macOS** - Improved search input focus and event handling ([#113](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/113)):
  - Added multiple focus attempts with staggered delays for reliable focus after context menu dismissal
  - Added `keyup` event listener as fallback for `input` events

---

## [0.18.18] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- **Couples grouping not detecting all couples** - "By couples" grouping now correctly groups all couples with `spouse_id` set ([#105](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/105)):
  - Changed from child-parent inference to direct spouse relationship detection
  - Fixes couples without children not being grouped
  - Fixes couples whose children use gender-neutral `parents` field instead of `father`/`mother`

- **Gender-neutral parents not respected** - Fixed two issues with the gender-neutral `parents`/`parents_id` fields ([#108](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/108)):
  - Bidirectional linker no longer auto-adds `father`/`mother` fields when `parents`/`parents_id` already exist and "Enable inclusive/gender-neutral parent fields" is enabled
  - Edit Person modal now correctly displays existing `parents` relationships when opened via file explorer context menu or Control Center

---

## [0.18.17] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **Rename file when person name changes** - Option to rename the note file when editing a person's name ([#107](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/107)):
  - When saving changes in Edit Person modal with a new name, prompts to rename the file
  - Handles duplicate filenames by appending a number (e.g., "John Smith 1.md")
  - Automatically updates relationship wikilinks in related notes (parents, spouses, children)
  - Uses `cr_id` matching to ensure correct relationships are updated

- **Canvas grouping for family units** - Visual groups to organize related nodes on canvases ([#105](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/105)):
  - Four grouping strategies: None, By generation, By couples, By collection
  - "By couples" groups parent pairs who share children (not including children)
  - Groups rendered as JSON Canvas 1.0 `type: "group"` nodes
  - Available in global settings (Preferences → Canvas styling) and per-tree in Tree Wizard
  - Works for both Canvas and Excalidraw output

- **Sensitive field redaction utilities** - Centralized utilities for filtering sensitive fields from exports ([#96](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/96)):
  - Added `SENSITIVE_FIELDS` constant with SSN and identity number fields
  - Added `isSensitiveField()` function to check if a field is sensitive
  - Added `filterSensitiveFields()` function to remove sensitive fields from frontmatter objects
  - Note: Current exporters already protect these fields implicitly by working with `PersonNode` interface, which excludes sensitive fields by design

### Fixed

- **Children display property not accumulating** - When adding multiple children via "Add child" button, the `children` display property now correctly shows all children instead of just the first ([#106](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/106)):
  - Fixed reading from legacy `child` property instead of normalized `children` property
  - Affected both Create Person modal and bidirectional linking

---

  - `cr_living: true` — Always treat as living (protected in exports)
  - `cr_living: false` — Always treat as deceased (not protected)
  - Absent `cr_living` uses automatic detection (existing behavior)
  - "Living status override" dropdown in Edit Person modal (shown when privacy protection enabled)
  - Supported in all export formats: GEDCOM, GEDCOM X, Gramps XML, CSV

### Fixed

- **Sibling ordering in Family Tree canvas** - Children from different parent pairs are now grouped together instead of being interleaved ([#103](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/103)):
  - Added post-processing step to group full-siblings by parent pair
  - Works around upstream family-chart library layout issue with multi-spouse families

  - Notes base template for Obsidian Bases with 11 views
  - Form state persistence for Create Note modal

### Fixed

- **Export text overflow** - Fixed text spilling outside card bounds in PNG/PDF exports; clip-path attributes now preserved during SVG preparation ([#88](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/88))
- **High Contrast theme readability** - Fixed white text on bright cyan/magenta backgrounds in dark mode; High Contrast preset now uses black text for accessibility ([#88](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/88))
- **Multi-line date display** - Birth and death dates now display on separate lines when both are enabled; cards automatically resize to accommodate the extra line ([#88](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/88))
- **Spacing state persistence** - Node and level spacing settings now persist across Obsidian restarts; added checkmarks to spacing menu items to indicate current selection ([#88](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/88))

---

## [0.18.14] - 2025-12-31

### Added

- **Edit Person Events & Sources** - Manage events and sources directly from the Edit Person modal ([#33](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/33)):
  - **Sources section**: Multi-value picker to link source notes with Link and Create buttons; stores as `sources` (wikilinks) and `sources_id` (cr_ids) arrays for reliable linking
  - **Events section**: Display events referencing this person with type badges and dates; link/unlink existing events or create new events with person pre-filled
  - **Type badges**: Color-coded type badges for both events and sources matching picker modal styles

### Fixed

- **Context menu Edit Person** - Fixed missing plugin reference causing "Plugin not available" error when clicking Link/Create buttons in Edit Person modal opened via context menu ([#33](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/33))
- **Children display in Edit Person** - Fixed children displaying as cr_ids instead of names in Edit Person modal; was reading from deprecated `child` property instead of `children` ([#86](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/86))
- **Duplicate children_id during Gramps import** - Fixed duplicate values appearing in `children_id` arrays after importing Gramps .gpkg files; bidirectional sync now suspended during import to prevent file watcher from triggering relationship sync before Phase 2 handle replacement ([#84](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/84))
- **Deprecated `child` property in imports** - New person notes now use `children` (plural) property instead of deprecated `child` (singular), matching v0.18.11 property naming normalization ([#85](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/85))
- **Lint warnings from Obsidian bot** - Fixed various lint issues flagged during PR review: Object stringification, async/await usage, deprecated method calls, innerHTML usage, and type assertions

---

## [0.18.13] - 2025-12-31

### Added

- **Gramps Notes Import** - Import notes attached to Gramps entities during Gramps XML import ([#36](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/36), [#76](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/76), [#77](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/77)):

  - Import notes attached to events appended to event note content
  - Import notes attached to places appended to place note content

### Fixed

- **Step/adoptive parent canvas positioning** - Fixed step/adoptive parents not rendering on generated canvas trees; positioning pass was missing after layout engine ([#75](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/75))
- **Circular relationship freeze** - Added cycle detection to prevent Obsidian from freezing when circular parent-child relationships exist (e.g., A is parent of B and B is parent of A); cycles are now detected and broken with a warning ([#83](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/83))

### Changed

- **Person note context menu reorganization** - Restructured the Charted Roots context menu for person notes to be less cluttered and more intuitive ([#82](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/82)):
  - Renamed "Add relationship..." to "Relationships" submenu
  - Moved "Validate relationships" and "Calculate relationship..." into Relationships submenu
  - Removed duplicate "More options..." entry (same as "Generate visual tree")
  - Added "More" submenu with less frequently used actions: Find on canvas, Open in map view, Set group name, Set collection, Insert dynamic blocks, Create place notes, Validate against schemas, Add essential properties, Add cr_id

---

## [0.18.12] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed

- **Adoptive parent relationship fixes** - Multiple fixes for adoptive parent relationships ([#75](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/75)):
  - Added `adoptive_parent`/`adoptive_parent_id` gender-neutral property support alongside existing `adoptive_father`/`adoptive_mother`
  - Added `adopted_child`/`adopted_child_id` parsing from parent's perspective with automatic reverse relationship
  - Fixed `parents_id` validation false positive ("Child doesn't list this person as parent")
  - Fixed adoptive parents rendering in Family Chart when biological parents also exist
  - Adoptive parents now appear on canvas trees when relationship is defined from either direction
- **Dynamic block metadata timing** - Timeline and relationships blocks now show "Waiting for metadata..." instead of errors when opened on newly created person notes, then auto-refresh when ready ([#74](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/74))
- **Timeline event detection** - Timeline block now listens for event note changes and file creation, so new events appear without requiring a page refresh ([#74](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/74))
- **Family Chart color dropdown** - Removed non-functional color scheme dropdown from Family Chart toolbar; sex-based coloring remains available via the palette button ([#72](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/72))
- **Settings label clarity** - Renamed "Maps folder" setting to "Map notes folder" to clarify it controls where map notes are created, not map images ([#71](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/71))
- **ESLint compliance** - Fixed 36 non-sentence-case ESLint errors across 15 files (unused imports, promise handling, style assignments, async/await issues)
- **Event template properties** - Templater event templates now use `persons` array instead of deprecated `person` property ([#69](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/69))

## [0.18.11] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- **Cleanup Wizard Phase 4** - UX improvements for the Post-Import Cleanup Wizard ([#65](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/65)):

  **Batch Progress Indicators**
  - Real-time progress bars during batch operations (Steps 2-6, 10-14)
  - Shows "Processing X of Y notes..." with current filename
  - UI re-renders every 5 items to show progress without excessive updates
  - Progress callbacks added to all batch methods in DataQualityService and migration services

  **Keyboard Navigation**
  - Arrow keys to navigate between tiles on overview screen
  - Enter/Space to activate focused tile
  - Escape to return to overview or close modal
  - ARIA attributes (role, aria-label) for screen reader accessibility
  - Visual focus indicators matching hover styles

- **Property Naming Normalization** - Standardized `child` → `children` property naming ([#65](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/65)):

  **Cleanup Wizard Step 14**
  - Batch migrate legacy `child` property to `children` across vault
  - Preview shows notes that will be updated
  - Merges with existing `children` if both properties exist (deduplicates)
  - Removes legacy `child` property after migration

  **Documentation Updates**

  - Deprecation notice added for `child` property
  - Updated example person note to use `children`

### Fixed

- **Cleanup Wizard extensibility** - Fixed hardcoded step count (10) to use `WIZARD_STEPS.length`, enabling future step additions without code changes

---

## [0.18.10] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- **Custom Map Authoring** - Streamlined custom map creation and place positioning ([#66](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/66)):

  **Map Creation Wizard**
  - 4-step guided wizard: select image → configure map → add initial places → review & create
  - Click on map preview to add places with coordinates auto-filled
  - Inline universe creation (create new universe without leaving wizard)
  - Modal state persistence allows resuming interrupted sessions
  - Entry point: Control Center → Maps → "Create map wizard"

  **Place Management in Map View**

  - Right-click place markers → Edit place, Open note, or Copy coordinates
  - Draggable place markers in Move Places mode with undo support
  - Proper coordinate conversion between DOM and Leaflet Simple CRS

  **Map View UX Improvements**
  - Toolbar buttons converted to icons with tooltips for space efficiency
  - Improved toolbar wrapping when sidebar reduces available width
  - "Open map" button in wizard now opens the newly created map

### Fixed

- **Event essential properties** - "Add essential event properties" context menu now adds `persons: []` array instead of deprecated singular `person` property ([#69](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/69))

---

## [0.18.9] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- **Nested Properties Redesign** - Flat property format for evidence tracking and life events, fixing Obsidian Properties panel compatibility ([#52](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/52)):

  **Evidence Tracking Migration (sourced_facts → sourced_*)**
  - Old nested `sourced_facts` object replaced with individual flat properties
  - 10 supported fact types: `sourced_birth_date`, `sourced_death_date`, `sourced_birth_place`, `sourced_death_place`, `sourced_name`, `sourced_sex`, `sourced_occupation`, `sourced_parents`, `sourced_spouse`, `sourced_children`
  - Each property is a simple list of wikilinks to source notes
  - Evidence Service reads both old and new formats for backward compatibility
  - Cleanup Wizard Step 12 migrates existing `sourced_facts` to flat format

  **Life Events Migration (events → event notes)**
  - Old inline `events` arrays replaced with links to separate event note files
  - New `life_events` property contains wikilinks to event notes
  - Event notes are first-class Obsidian notes with full metadata, tags, and attachments
  - Cleanup Wizard Step 13 creates event notes and updates person notes
  - Event notes created in configurable Events folder with proper frontmatter

  **Cleanup Wizard Enhancements**
  - Expanded from 11 to 13 steps
  - Step 12: Migrate Sourced Facts (sourced_facts → sourced_* properties)
  - Step 13: Migrate Life Events (events arrays → event note files)
  - Migration completion tracking prevents redundant migrations
  - Preview shows exactly what will be created/modified

  **Migration Notice**
  - One-time notice view shows what changed and recommended actions
  - Visual comparison of old vs new formats
  - Checkmarks indicate completed migrations
  - Direct link to Cleanup Wizard

- **Custom Relationships on Canvas Trees** - Custom relationship types with flat properties and family tree integration:
  - **Flat format**: `godparent: ["[[John Smith]]"]`, `godparent_id: ["john_123"]`
  - **Pattern**: Each relationship type uses its ID as the property name
  - **Parallel arrays**: Optional `_id`, `_from`, `_to` suffix properties for metadata
  - **Properties UI compatible**: All properties are simple lists or text values
  - **Backward compatible**: Legacy `relationships` array still read for existing data
  - **Family tree integration**: New `includeOnFamilyTree` and `familyGraphMapping` properties
  - **Custom types**: Can opt-in to family tree display via relationship type editor UI

---

## [0.18.8] - 2025-12-30

### Added

- **Inline media folder configuration** - When uploading media with no folder configured, an inline folder picker now appears instead of just showing an error notice. Set the folder directly in the modal and continue uploading.

### Fixed

- **Context menu relationship actions** - "Add father/mother/spouse/child" now correctly write both wikilink and ID fields (dual storage pattern), fixing bidirectional linking
- **Metadata cache timing** - Pass cr_id directly when selecting newly created people, avoiding cache timing issues that caused "could not find cr_id" errors
- **Family chart view stability** - Chart no longer becomes unusable when returning to the tab after modifying other notes. The view now defers refresh until visible and preserves zoom/pan state during refreshes

---

## [0.18.7] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- **Inclusive Parent Relationships** - Opt-in gender-neutral parent support for diverse family structures ([#63](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/63)):

  **Settings (Control Center > Preferences)**
  - Enable Inclusive Parents toggle (default: OFF) - opt-in feature
  - Parent Field Label text setting for customization (default: "Parents")
    - Examples: "Parents", "Guardians", "Progenitors", "Lolos"
    - Label shown in UI only; frontmatter always uses `parents` property
  - Conditional visibility: label setting only shown when toggle enabled

  **Schema Changes**
  - New `parents` property (wikilinks, can be array for multiple parents)
  - New `parents_id` property (Charted Roots IDs, dual storage pattern)
  - Independent of `father`/`mother` - users can use either or both
  - Supports mixed usage for blended families or migration scenarios

  **Create/Edit Person Modal**
  - Parents field appears when setting enabled (above father/mother)
  - Multi-select person picker (same pattern as children field)
  - Inline parent creation via person picker
  - No gender pre-fill (unlike father/mother)
  - Uses custom label from settings

  **Family Graph Integration**
  - FamilyGraphService reads `parents`/`parents_id` relationships
  - Included in ancestor/descendant calculations
  - Same treatment as father/mother for graph traversal
  - Spouse edges between 2 parents (same pattern as father/mother)
  - Priority order for fallback: biological → gender-neutral → adoptive

  **Bidirectional Linking**
  - When person added to `parents` array, automatically adds to each parent's `children` array
  - Uses dual storage: both wikilinks (`parents`) and IDs (`parents_id`)
  - Deduplication prevents duplicate entries
  - Handles removal: when parent removed, child removed from their `children`
  - Supports aliased wikilinks (`[[basename|name]]`) when filename differs from name

  **Relationship Displays**
  - Relationships Block (`canvas-roots-relationships`): Shows parents with "Parent" label
  - Family Chart View: Displays gender-neutral parents in interactive tree
  - Sibling Detection: Checks gender-neutral parents' children for siblings

  **Design Principles**
  - Opt-in, not replacement - father/mother fields remain; this adds alongside
  - Configurable - users customize terminology to their preference
  - Non-disruptive - users with traditional setups see no UI changes
  - Coexistent - can use father, mother, AND parents simultaneously

---

## [0.18.6] - 2025-12-29

### Added

- **Media Upload and Management Enhancement** - Comprehensive file upload system allowing users to upload media directly from Charted Roots and link to entities without manual file management ([#60](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/60)):

  **1. Settings Enhancement**
  - Drag-and-drop reordering of media folders in Preferences
  - First folder in list becomes upload destination
  - Visual feedback during drag operations with grip handle

  **2. Expanded Media Manager Dashboard**
  - 6-tile layout (3×2 grid) vs. previous 4-tile layout
  - Row 1 (Browse & Discover): Linked Media Gallery, Find Unlinked, Source Media Linker
  - Row 2 (Add & Link): Upload Media, Link Media, Bulk Link to Entities

  **3. Standalone Upload Modal**
  - Drag-and-drop file upload with browse fallback
  - Upload to first configured media folder
  - Read-only destination display with helpful hint
  - Multiple file selection support
  - Auto-rename collision handling (incremental numbering: `photo.jpg` → `photo 1.jpg`)
  - File type validation
  - Optional entity linking after upload

  **4. Inline Upload in Media Picker**
  - "Upload files..." button in MediaPickerModal
  - Follows PlacePickerModal "Create new place" pattern
  - Auto-selects newly uploaded files
  - Available in both context menu and Dashboard workflows

  **5. Entity Picker Modal**
  - Select entities after choosing media files (media-first workflow)
  - Supports all entity types: Person, Event, Place, Organization, Source
  - **Person-specific filters:**
    - Living status: All / Living only / Deceased only
    - Birth date: All / Has date / Missing date
    - Sex: All / Male / Female
  - **Person-specific sorting:**
    - Name (A-Z / Z-A)
    - Birth year (oldest first / youngest first)
    - Recently modified
  - Shows which entities already have selected media linked
  - Bulk linking with progress modal for ≥5 entities

  **6. Consistent Upload Availability**
  - Context menu flow: Right-click entity → Media → Link media → Upload files
  - Media Manager tile: Link Media → Upload files
  - Both workflows use same enhanced MediaPickerModal

- **"Create new" buttons in picker modals** - Added inline creation to streamline workflows:
  - **Context menu relationship flows**: All relationship context menu options now show "Create new" buttons
    - "Add father" → Shows "Create new father" button with sex pre-filled as male
    - "Add mother" → Shows "Create new mother" button with sex pre-filled as female
    - "Add spouse" → Shows "Create new spouse" button with opposite sex suggested (if known)
    - "Add child" → Shows "Create new child" button
    - "Add custom relationship" → Shows "Create new [relationship type]" button
  - **Event creation flow**:
    - Primary person field now uses a picker modal with "Create new person" button
    - Place field now uses a picker modal with "Create new place" button
    - Replaces plain text inputs with proper Link/Unlink buttons
  - Matches the behavior of the Create Person modal for a consistent user experience
  - Streamlines workflow from 3 steps (close modal, create note, re-open modal) down to 1 step

### Changed

- **Split "Add parent" into "Add father" and "Add mother"** - Context menu now shows separate options instead of prompting with an intermediate modal:
  - Eliminates the extra step of choosing parent type
  - More discoverable and straightforward
  - Consistent with having separate "Create new father" and "Create new mother" buttons

### Fixed

- **Research gaps counting bug** - Fixed inflated unsourced facts count in Control Center Research Gaps widget:
  - Previously counted all facts as "unsourced" for every person note in the vault, even those without GPS tracking enabled
  - Now only counts unsourced facts for people who have the `sourced_facts` property (actively using GPS tracking)
  - Example: With 24 people using GPS tracking and 7 fact types, the count was showing 169 unsourced facts (24×7), even though many people had complete tracking

- **Timeline filter not working with persons array** - Fixed timeline person filter to properly match events using the `persons` array field:
  - Timeline person filter now checks both the singular `person` field and the `persons` array
  - Events with multiple people are now properly included when filtering by any person's name
  - Substring matching now works correctly for aliased person names

- **Events view not showing linked people** - Fixed "Person" column in Events tab to display all linked people:
  - Person column now shows all people from both `person` (singular) and `persons` (array) fields
  - Multiple people are displayed comma-separated in the table
  - Events no longer appear to have no linked people when using the `persons` array

---

## [0.18.5] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

- **Bidirectional linking for spouse's children** - Fixed critical regression where children added to a parent would not be automatically linked to the parent's spouse:
  - When adding a child to a parent who has a spouse, the child is now automatically linked to both parents, and both parents get the child in their `children_id` arrays
  - Implemented by suspending the background `BidirectionalLinker` service during manual relationship updates to prevent interference
  - Example: Creating Father, adding Mother as spouse, then adding children now correctly links all family members bidirectionally

- **Double bracket issue in child names** - Fixed bug where child names would accumulate multiple layers of brackets (e.g., `[[[[Child Name]]]]`):
  - Added `stripWikilink()` helper function to remove existing brackets before `createSmartWikilink()` adds new ones
  - Prevents bracket duplication when reading existing child names from frontmatter and re-writing them

- **Missing "Link" text on spouse button** - Added "Link" text label to spouse link button in create person modal (was showing only icon)

- **Data quality checker incorrectly flagging schema-defined structures** - Fixed false warnings for intentional nested structures:
  - `sourced_facts` and `evidence` properties are now whitelisted and won't trigger "nested structure" warnings
  - Cleanup wizard will no longer flatten these properties, preventing breakage of the Evidence Service
  - Users can now safely use GPS (Genealogical Proof Standard) research tracking features without getting false data quality warnings

---

## [0.18.4] - 2025-12-29

### Changed

- **CSS Architecture Refactoring** - Improved maintainability and organization of the plugin's CSS codebase:
  - **Split massive modals.css** (12,488 lines) into 6 focused component files organized by functional domain:
    - `control-center.css` (5,675 lines) - Core Control Center UI (tabs, navigation, cards)
    - `import-export-wizard.css` (1,778 lines) - Import/Export wizard modals
    - `cleanup-wizard.css` (2,134 lines) - Cleanup wizard with all 9 steps
    - `media-modals.css` (1,427 lines) - Media picker, manager, gallery, bulk link modals
    - `place-modals.css` (933 lines) - Place creation, standardization, merge, and network modals
    - `entity-create-modals.css` (542 lines) - Person picker and entity creation forms
  - **Removed 5 empty/unused CSS files** - Deleted `canvas.css`, `edges.css`, `theme.css`, `nodes.css`, and `animations.css` that contained no meaningful styles

### Fixed

- **CSS duplicate definitions** - Resolved critical CSS conflicts that could cause unpredictable styling behavior:
  - `.cr-progress-bar` - Removed duplicate definition, now uses modifier classes (--good, --medium, --bad)
  - `.crc-field-list` - Converted to scoped selectors to prevent conflicts between different contexts
  - `.cr-modal-buttons` - Consolidated to single base definition in `base.css`

- **Missing bidirectional parent-child relationship linking** - Fixed critical bug where creating a person with parents or children would only create one-way relationships. Now all relationship creation flows properly maintain bidirectional links:
  - **Person creation**: When you create a person and link them to a father/mother, the parent's `children_id` array is automatically updated. When you add children during creation, each child's `father_id` or `mother_id` is automatically set based on the parent's sex.
  - **Post-create actions**: When using "Add child", "Add spouse", or "Add parent" buttons in the post-creation flow, both sides of the relationship are now properly updated.
  - **Spouse relationships**: Refactored existing spouse linking to use proper dual storage (wikilink + ID) via `updatePersonNote()`.

  This ensures family relationships are always bidirectional across all creation flows, not just for spouse relationships.

---

## [0.18.3] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed

- **Wikilink handling for duplicate names** - The plugin now properly handles entities with duplicate names (e.g., "John Doe 1.md" for a person named "John Doe") throughout the codebase using Obsidian's wikilink alias format `[[filename|display name]]`. This fixes:
  - Bidirectional relationship linking when adding parents, spouses, or children
  - Note creation for persons, events, places, and organizations
  - All importers (GEDCOM, Gramps XML, GedcomX JSON, CSV)
  - All exporters (GEDCOM, Gramps XML, GedcomX JSON)
  - Dynamic content blocks (timeline, relationships, media gallery)
  - Report generators (timeline, place summary, collection overview, media inventory)

- **"Add essential properties" using wrong property name** - Fixed "Add essential source properties" and "Add essential event properties" context menu actions incorrectly setting `type` instead of `cr_type`. Person, place, and universe actions already used the correct property name. Also updated place standardization and organization membership filtering to check both `cr_type` (preferred) and legacy `type` for backward compatibility.

---

## [0.18.2] - 2025-12-28

### Added

- **Timeline Export Consolidation** - All 8 timeline export formats are now available from a single location: **Statistics & Reports → Reports → Timeline**. This consolidates functionality that was previously split between the Events tab Export card and the Reports wizard.

  **Unified formats:**
  - Visual exports: Canvas, Excalidraw (requires Excalidraw plugin)
  - Documents: PDF, ODT
  - Markdown: Vertical timeline (callouts), Table, Simple list, Dataview query

  **Consolidated options:**
  - All filters from both systems (person, event type, group, place, universe, date range)
  - Canvas/Excalidraw styling (layout, color scheme, ordering edges)
  - Excalidraw drawing options (style, font, stroke width)
  - PDF/ODT options (page size, date format, cover page)
  - Grouping options (none, by year, by decade, by person, by place)
  - Data quality insights (timeline gaps, unsourced events, orphan events)

- **Deprecation notice on Events tab Export card** - The Export card in Control Center → Events now displays a notice directing users to the unified Reports wizard. The Export card will be removed in a future release.

### Fixed

- **Excalidraw timeline exports showing raw file paths** - Event nodes in Excalidraw exports now display formatted labels (e.g., "BIRTH of John Smith (1850)") instead of raw file paths like "People/events/birth-john-smith.md".

- **Excalidraw text positioning** - Text labels in Excalidraw exports are now properly centered within their containing rectangles.

- **ODT table column misalignment with wikilinks** - Fixed an issue where wikilinks with aliases (e.g., `[[file|display]]`) would cause table columns to misalign in ODT exports. The pipe character inside wikilinks is no longer incorrectly treated as a cell delimiter.

- **Canvas year markers in timeline exports** - Year marker text nodes now display properly formatted year labels instead of placeholder text.

- **Intermediate canvas file cleanup** - When exporting to Excalidraw format, the intermediate canvas file is now automatically deleted after successful conversion.

- **Restored "Open in family chart" context menu action** - Re-added the missing menu item for person notes under the Charted Roots submenu.

---

## [0.18.1] - 2025-12-28

### Added

- **Family Creation Wizard** - New 5-step wizard for creating interconnected family groups. Start from scratch by creating a central person, or build around an existing person in your vault. Add spouses, children, and parents with automatic bidirectional relationship linking. Access via command palette ("Charted Roots: Create family wizard"), Dashboard tile, People tab actions, or folder context menu.

- **Inline person creation in Edit Modal** - Create new people directly from relationship fields (spouse, father, mother, children) without leaving the Edit Modal. Click the "+" button next to any relationship field to open a mini-form, enter basic details, and the new person is created and linked automatically.

- **Children management in Edit Modal** - New "Children" section in the Edit Modal displays existing children and allows adding new ones via person picker or inline creation. Children are stored using `child` (display names) and `children_id` (cr_id references) array properties.

- **"Add Another" flow for Create Person modal** - After creating a person, choose "Create & Add Another" to immediately create another person in the same folder, or use "Create & Open" to create and navigate to the new note.

- **Nickname property support** - New `nickname` frontmatter property for person notes, displayed in Edit Modal header alongside the formal name. Useful for informal names, pet names, or alternate identities.

- **Folder context menu integration** - Right-click on people folders to access "Create person" and "Create family" actions directly, with the selected folder pre-populated as the destination.

- **State persistence for Family Wizard** - If the Family Creation Wizard is accidentally closed, your progress is saved. When reopening, you'll see a prompt to restore or discard the previous session.

### Changed

- **Edit Modal relationship fields** - Relationship fields (spouse, father, mother) now show inline "Create new" buttons that open a mini-form for creating and linking new people without leaving the modal.

### Fixed

- **Family Wizard relationship merging** - When building a family around an existing person who already has relationships, new relationships are now merged with existing ones instead of overwriting them.

---

## [0.18.0] - 2025-12-28

### Changed

- **Event person property consolidation** - Event notes now use a single `persons` array property for all event types, replacing the previous dual-property approach (`person` for single-participant events, `persons` for multi-participant events). This simplifies data management and enables multi-participant support for all event types.

  **Old format (deprecated):**
  ```yaml
  # Single-participant event
  person: "[[John Smith]]"

  # Multi-participant event
  persons:
    - "[[John Smith]]"
    - "[[Jane Doe]]"
  ```

  **New format (all events):**
  ```yaml
  persons:
    - "[[John Smith]]"
  ```

### Added

- **Event person migration step in Cleanup Wizard** - Step 11 in the Post-Import Cleanup Wizard detects and migrates event notes using the legacy `person` property to the `persons` array format. Includes preview with merge detection for notes that have both properties.

- **Migration notice for v0.18.0** - Users upgrading from v0.17.x see a one-time notice explaining the event person property change with examples and a link to the Cleanup Wizard.

### Migration

The legacy `person` property continues to be read for backward compatibility. To migrate existing notes:

1. Open the Cleanup Wizard (Control Center → Data Quality → Cleanup Wizard, or command palette)
2. Navigate to Step 11: "Migrate Event Person Properties"
3. Review detected notes and click "Apply All" to migrate

---

## [0.17.9] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **"All places" layer in Map View** - New layer toggle in the Layers menu shows all places with coordinates, not just those referenced by person events. Useful for viewing standalone places on custom maps, especially for fictional worlds where places may not yet have associated person notes.

- **Pixel coordinate support in Create Place modal** - When creating fictional, mythological, or legendary places, the modal now shows pixel coordinate fields (X/Y) instead of geographic coordinates. These coordinates are used for pixel-based custom maps.

- **Wikilink support for custom map images** - Map image paths can now use wikilink syntax (`[[path/to/image.png]]`), allowing Obsidian to automatically update paths when images are moved or renamed. The Create Map modal now stores image paths as wikilinks by default.

- **Map auto-refresh on note changes** - Maps now automatically refresh when place or person notes are modified, using Obsidian's metadata cache events for reliable change detection.

### Fixed

- **Dynamic block order ignored during import** - Fixed issue where the Media block always appeared last in person notes regardless of the configured order. Dynamic blocks now respect the order specified in `dynamicBlockTypes`, placing Media first by default.

- **Custom maps not appearing in gallery after creation** - Fixed issue where newly created custom maps wouldn't appear in the Control Center Maps tab gallery. The gallery now correctly detects maps using the `cr_type: map` frontmatter property in addition to the legacy `type: map` format.

- **Pixel coordinate format mismatch** - Fixed issue where places with pixel coordinates weren't appearing on maps. The map data service now reads multiple property formats (`pixel_x`/`pixel_y`, `custom_coordinates_x`/`custom_coordinates_y`) for compatibility.

---

## [0.17.8] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed

- **Gramps import: multiple events of same type silently skipped** - Fixed issue where multiple events of the same type with the same participants (e.g., several residence events for a married couple) would only import the first event. The filename now includes the event date to ensure uniqueness. (#43)

---

## [0.17.7] - 2025-12-27

### Changed

- **Events base: unified Person(s) column** - The events base template now uses a single "Person(s)" column that displays clickable links for both single-person events (`person` property) and multi-person events (`persons` property). Previously, these were separate columns or the multi-person events didn't display properly.

### Fixed

- **Create Person modal crash with array collection property** - Fixed TypeError when opening the Create Person modal if any person note had a `collection` property stored as an array instead of a string. The modal now safely handles array-type collection values.

- **Gramps import: events at same place incorrectly deduplicated** - Fixed issue where multiple events of the same type, with the same participants, on the same date, but at different places were incorrectly treated as duplicates. The deduplication key now includes place name, ensuring events like multiple residence records are imported correctly.

---

## [0.17.6] - 2025-12-27

### Fixed

- **Gramps import: family events missing Person field** - Events with multiple participants (marriage, divorce, residence, etc.) now correctly populate the Person property when importing from Gramps. These events are attached to families rather than persons in Gramps XML, and are now properly linked to both spouses.

- **"Create person note" command opening retired tab** - The command palette "Charted Roots: Create person note" command now directly opens the Create Person modal instead of attempting to open the retired Data Entry tab in Control Center.

---

## [0.17.5] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **Research Level property for tracking research progress** - New `research_level` property (0-6) on person notes to track progress toward GPS-compliant documentation, based on Yvette Hoitink's "Six Levels of Ancestral Profiles" system. Levels range from 0 (Unidentified) to 6 (Biography). Select via dropdown in Create/Edit Person modal.

- **Research Level in Gaps Report** - The Gaps Report now includes research level features: filter by research level (e.g., show only Level 0-2), sort by research level, display level in report table, and summary statistics showing count of ancestors at each level range.

- **Research Level export to GEDCOM and Gramps** - The `research_level` property is exported as `_RESEARCH_LEVEL` custom tag in GEDCOM files and as `<attribute type="Research Level">` in Gramps XML exports.

- **Research Level import from GEDCOM and Gramps** - When importing files that contain research level data (from previous Charted Roots exports), the `_RESEARCH_LEVEL` tag (GEDCOM) or "Research Level" attribute (Gramps) is automatically imported back into person notes.

- **Research Level in Bases** - Person bases include "By research level" grouped view, "Needs research" filtered view (Level ≤ 2), and "Not assessed" filtered view for tracking research progress across your tree.

- **Media folder selection for Gramps .gpkg import** - When importing `.gpkg` files with bundled media, a dropdown in the Preview step lets you choose the destination folder: configured media folders from Preferences, the default `Charted Roots/Media`, or a custom path. Option to preserve the original folder structure from the package.

### Changed

- **Control Center Tools icons and order** - Updated icons: Reports now uses `file-text`, Statistics uses `chart-bar-decreasing`. Reordered tools to: Templates, Media Manager, Family Chart, Import/Export, Reports, Statistics.

### Fixed

- **Source Media Linker showing already-linked images** - The Link Media to Sources wizard now excludes images that are already attached to a source note. Previously, images would appear in the list even after being linked, requiring manual tracking of which files had been processed.

- **Townships incorrectly flagged as non-standard place types** - Townships are now recognized as valid administrative divisions and will no longer appear in the "Standardize place types" cleanup wizard. Added `township` as a built-in place type at hierarchy level 6 (below county), appropriate for US Midwest/Northeast civil townships.

## [0.17.4] - 2025-12-27

### Added

- **Statistics entry in Control Center Tools** - Added Statistics to the Tools group in Control Center, providing an entry point to the Statistics View. Previously, Statistics View was only accessible via command palette after the old Statistics tab was retired.

- **Configured media folders in Bulk Media Linker** - The Link Media to Sources wizard now offers to use media folders configured in Control Center → Preferences. When folders are configured, users can select from them with checkboxes or switch to custom folder entry. Files from multiple configured folders are combined automatically.

### Fixed

- **Table overflow in Bulk Media Linker** - Fixed table columns spilling outside the modal. Column widths are now fixed with proper proportions, and the Apply button is no longer cut off.

- **Pagination in Bulk Media Linker** - Link step now shows 10 rows at a time with "Show more" and "Show all" buttons, preventing UI sluggishness with large file sets.

- **Focus loss in Media folder field** - Fixed input losing focus on every keystroke. Now only updates when selecting from suggestions or pressing Enter, matching the Control Center preferences behavior.

- **Individual Apply button per row** - Added ability to apply links one at a time from the Link step, with checkmark showing applied status. Review and Execute steps now show only pending (unapplied) links.

- **Confidence dot alignment** - Confidence indicator dots are now vertically aligned with filenames in a styled wrapper div.

---

## [0.17.3] - 2025-12-26

### Fixed

- **Duplicate name wikilinks in GEDCOM import** - When importing GEDCOM files with duplicate names (e.g., two people named "John Smith"), the relationship wikilinks now correctly point to the actual filenames (e.g., `[[John Smith]]` and `[[John Smith-1]]`) instead of all pointing to the same name.

- **Duplicate event note filenames during import** - Fixed "File already exists" errors when importing GEDCOM files with multiple events that generate identical titles (e.g., multiple "Marriage of Unknown and Unknown" events). The importer now tracks created filenames during the import session and includes retry logic to handle race conditions with vault indexing.

- **Missing space in timeline block** - Fixed missing space between event type and "in" preposition (e.g., "Bornin" now correctly displays as "Born in").

- **Bases not created during import** - Bases files (people.base, places.base, etc.) are now created after import even when some errors occur. Previously, any import error would prevent bases creation even though notes were successfully created.

---

## [0.17.2] - 2025-12-26

### Added

- **Resume unsaved work in create entity modals** - All create entity modals (Person, Place, Event, Organization, Source) now persist form state when closed without saving. When reopened, a banner offers to restore the previous session's data or discard it. State expires after 24 hours. Edit mode is excluded from persistence.

### Fixed

- **Base templates not created on import** - Import Wizard now auto-creates base templates (people, places, events, sources, organizations) after successful imports, matching the Control Center behavior.

- **Dynamic blocks not updating on frontmatter changes** - The `canvas-roots-media`, `canvas-roots-timeline`, and `canvas-roots-relationships` code blocks now automatically re-render when frontmatter properties are modified, without requiring the note to be closed and reopened.

### Changed

- **Dynamic block order** - When automatically added to person notes, dynamic code blocks now appear in the order: Media, Timeline, Relationships (previously Timeline, Relationships, Media).

- **Dynamic blocks enabled by default** - The "Include dynamic blocks" option in Create Person modal is now enabled by default, automatically adding Media, Timeline, and Relationships code blocks to new person notes.

---

## [0.17.1] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Excalidraw export format** - Generate Tree wizard now supports Excalidraw output. Creates hand-drawn style family tree diagrams using ExcalidrawAutomate API when available, with JSON fallback.
  - Smart connectors that adapt when elements are moved
  - Spouse relationships styled with dashed lines
  - Wiki links on nodes for navigation back to person notes
  - Rich labels with name, dates, and birthplace
  - Dedicated style options step with drawing style, font, fill, and stroke settings
  - Node content options: name only, name + dates, or name + dates + places

### Fixed

- **Text centering in Excalidraw boxes** - Text labels are now properly centered within node rectangles.

- **Duplicate boxes in Excalidraw output** - Fixed issue where using the EA box parameter created visible text containers alongside rectangles.

- **Wiki link brackets in labels** - Wiki link syntax (`[[Link]]`) is now stripped from text labels; links are set via the element's link property instead.

- **Temporary canvas file cleanup** - Excalidraw export no longer leaves behind an intermediate `.canvas` file.

- **Generate button reactivity** - Canvas name input changes now immediately update the Generate button state.

### Internal

- **ESLint compliance** - Fixed all non-sentence-case lint issues across the codebase:
  - Replaced TFile casts with instanceof checks

  - Fixed floating promises with void operator
  - Fixed case declarations in switch blocks
  - Changed Vault.delete/trash to FileManager.trashFile
  - Removed unused imports and eslint-disable directives

- **Default canvas name** - Generate Tree wizard step 6 now pre-populates with "Family Tree" instead of requiring manual entry.

---

## [0.17.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Post-Import Cleanup Wizard** - 10-step guided wizard that consolidates post-import data quality operations into a single sequential workflow. Accessible via command palette ("Charted Roots: Post-Import Cleanup Wizard"), Data Quality tab, or Import Wizard completion screen.
  - Step 1: Quality Report (review-only with collapsible categories)
  - Step 2: Fix Bidirectional Relationships
  - Step 3: Normalize Date Formats
  - Step 4: Normalize Gender Values
  - Step 5: Clear Orphan References
  - Step 6: Migrate Source Properties (indexed to array format)
  - Step 7: Standardize Place Variants (interactive)
  - Step 8: Bulk Geocode (interactive with progress)
  - Step 9: Enrich Place Hierarchy (interactive)
  - Step 10: Flatten Nested Properties

- **Wizard session persistence** - Cleanup wizard state is saved to settings, allowing interrupted sessions to be resumed. Progress, completed steps, and pending issues are preserved.

- **v0.17.0 Migration Notice** - One-time workspace tab displayed when upgrading to v0.17.0, explaining the source format change and providing direct access to the Cleanup Wizard.

- **Sources property alias support** - The `sources` property can now be aliased like other person note properties (Settings > Property Aliases).

### Changed

- **Source property format** - Sources are now stored as a YAML array (`sources: [...]`) instead of indexed properties (`source`, `source_2`, `source_3`). All importers (GEDCOM, Gramps, GEDCOM X, CSV) now write the array format.

### Breaking Changes

- **Indexed source format removed** - The legacy indexed source format (`source`, `source_2`, `source_3`) is no longer parsed. Notes using this format will not have their sources recognized until migrated. Use the Cleanup Wizard Step 6 to convert existing notes to the array format.

---

## [0.16.1] - 2025-12-25

### Added

- **Expandable parse warnings** - Import wizard Step 4 (Preview) now shows a clickable warning section with chevron icon. Click to expand and view up to 10 warning details, with "...and X more" shown if there are additional warnings.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate event detection in Gramps import** - Gramps importer now detects and skips duplicate events (same type + person + date) that may exist in the source file. Duplicate count is displayed in the import summary.

- **Progress reporting for relationships phase** - Gramps import progress indicator now updates during the relationship linking phase, which previously showed no progress while relationships were being established.

- **Media block missing from dynamic blocks** - All importers (GEDCOM, Gramps, CSV, GEDCOM X) now include the media block in person notes by default. Previously only timeline and relationships blocks were created.

---

- **Media folder filtering** - New settings to specify which folders to scan for media files. Used by Find Unlinked Media, Media Manager stats, and Media Picker.

### Changed

- **Import wizards include media blocks** - When "Include dynamic blocks" is enabled, imported person notes now include all three block types (timeline, relationships, media). Media blocks are included with `editable: true` by default.

- **Insert dynamic blocks includes media** - Context menu action and bulk folder operation now add the media block alongside timeline and relationships blocks.

### Fixed

- **ESLint compliance** - Fixed all non-sentence-case ESLint errors for Obsidian plugin review compliance: async functions without await, misused promises in event handlers, floating promises, unused variables, and TFile cast issues.

---

### Added

- **Place linking for birth/death locations** - The Create Person modal now supports linking birth and death places to existing place notes, using the same pattern as family relationships. Click "Link" to open a place picker that searches all place notes, with options to filter by category. If the place doesn't exist, click "Create new place" to create it on-the-fly. Places are stored with dual fields (birth_place + birth_place_id) for reliable resolution.

---

## [0.13.1] - 2025-12-18

### Added

- **Family Chart horizontal orientation** - New option in Layout menu to switch between vertical (top-to-bottom) and horizontal (left-to-right) tree layouts.

### Added

- **Log export button** - New "Export logs" button in Developer settings allows saving the current session log to a file with optional obfuscation of personal data.

### Fixed

- **Duplicate children_id during Gramps import** - Fixed a race condition where bidirectional sync added relationship IDs while import was still in progress, causing duplicate `children_id` entries.

---

## [0.12.12] - 2025-12-17

### Added

- **Configurable sex normalization** - New setting in Preferences to control how "Normalize sex values" behaves: Standard (GEDCOM M/F), Schema-aware (respects custom sex enum values defined in schemas), or Disabled (never normalize). Schema-aware mode allows worldbuilders to protect custom sex values like "hermaphrodite" or "neuter" from normalization.

- **Universe field in Edit Person modal** - The universe dropdown now appears when editing a person via the file explorer context menu, matching the behavior when editing from the Control Center People tab.

### Changed

- **GEDCOM-standard sex values** - Canonical sex values changed from `male`/`female`/`nonbinary`/`unknown` to GEDCOM-standard `M`/`F`/`X`/`U`. Built-in synonyms automatically map common values (`male`→`M`, `female`→`F`, etc.) without requiring manual configuration.

### Fixed

- **Sex value normalization** - "Normalize sex values" now works out of the box with built-in mappings. Previously required manual value alias configuration to detect any changes.

- **Edit Person modal universe field** - Fixed universe dropdown not appearing when opening Edit Person modal from file explorer context menu. The modal now correctly loads existing universes from both place and person notes.

---

## [0.12.11] - 2025-12-17

### Changed

- **Tree Output tab two-panel layout** - Redesigned Tree Output tab with a two-panel layout: scrollable configuration accordions on the left, sticky preview and generate buttons on the right. Root person picker is now compact with inline radio buttons, names, and dates.

### Fixed

- **Tree Output accordion labels truncating** - Fixed setting labels in accordion sections (like "Tree type") being cut off due to constrained flexbox layout.

- **Statistics tab label wrapping** - Fixed Data completeness card labels wrapping mid-word by adding proper whitespace handling.

---

## [0.12.10] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Step & adoptive parent support** - Comprehensive support for non-biological parent relationships, improving GEDCOM import fidelity and enabling accurate representation of blended families.

- **Gramps XML pedigree parsing** - Parse `mrel` and `frel` attributes from Gramps `<childref>` elements. Relationship types mapped: `Birth` → biological, `Stepchild` → step-parent, `Adopted` → adoptive parent. Uses the same dedicated frontmatter fields as GEDCOM import.

- **GEDCOM X lineage type parsing** - Parse lineage type facts (`AdoptiveParent`, `StepParent`, `BiologicalParent`, etc.) from GEDCOM X parent-child relationships. Uses the same dedicated frontmatter fields as GEDCOM and Gramps import.

- **Step/adoptive parent export** - Export step-parent and adoptive parent relationships to all three formats. GEDCOM 5.5.1 exports PEDI tags (`step`, `adop`) under FAMC references. Gramps XML exports `mrel`/`frel` attributes (`Stepchild`, `Adopted`) on childref elements. GEDCOM X exports ParentChild relationships with lineage type facts.

- **Canvas tree visualization** - Step-parent relationships shown with dashed lines; adoptive parent relationships shown with dotted lines. New toggles in tree generation: "Include step-parents" and "Include adoptive parents". Relationship labels displayed on non-biological parent edges.

- **Create/Edit Person modal** - New "Step & adoptive parents" section for manual entry of stepfather, stepmother, adoptive father, and adoptive mother.

- **Statistics parent breakdown** - Parent type breakdown in Data Completeness section (biological vs. step vs. adoptive). New quality metrics: "Biologically orphaned" (no biological parents but has step/adoptive) and blended family insights showing count of people with multiple parent types.

- **New frontmatter fields** - `stepfather_id`, `stepmother_id` (arrays for multiple), `adoptive_father_id`, `adoptive_mother_id` with corresponding property aliases.

- **New relationship types** - Built-in `step_parent`, `step_child`, `adoptive_parent`, `adopted_child` relationship types with distinct line styles.

## [0.12.9] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Family Chart "Open note" button** - Person cards in the Family Chart view now have a small button in the top-right corner that opens the person's note in a new tab. Works in both view and edit modes, providing quick access to notes without changing the card click behavior.

- **Statistics Dashboard** - New workspace view with comprehensive vault metrics including entity counts, data completeness percentages, gender distribution, and date range spanning all entities. Access via Control Center Statistics tab or command palette.

- **Data quality analysis** - Quality section with severity-coded alerts (error/warning/info) for date inconsistencies, missing birth/death dates, orphaned people, incomplete parents, unsourced events, and places without coordinates. All issues are expandable with drill-down to see affected records.

- **Top lists with drill-down** - Interactive lists for top surnames, locations, occupations, and sources. Click any item to expand and see all matching people as clickable chips with right-click context menu and hover preview.

- **Extended statistics** - Demographic analysis including longevity (average lifespan by birth decade and location), family size patterns, marriage patterns (age at marriage by sex, remarriage rates), migration flows (birth-to-death location changes with top routes), source coverage by generation, and timeline density with gap detection.

- **Genealogical reports** - Generate formatted reports from the Statistics Dashboard:
  - **Family Group Sheet** - Single family unit with parents, marriage, and children
  - **Individual Summary** - Complete record of one person with all events and sources
  - **Ahnentafel Report** - Numbered ancestor list (1=subject, 2=father, 3=mother, etc.)
  - **Gaps Report** - Analysis of missing data by category
  - **Register Report** - Descendants with NGSQ-style numbering
  - **Pedigree Chart** - Ancestor tree in markdown format
  - **Descendant Chart** - Descendant tree in markdown format

### Fixed

- **Orphaned people calculation** - Fixed bug where orphaned people count showed negative values due to incorrect subtraction of overlapping sets. Now correctly filters for people with no relationships at all.

---

## [0.12.8] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **Dynamic content blocks** - New `canvas-roots-timeline` and `canvas-roots-relationships` code blocks that render live, computed content in person notes. Timeline shows chronological events; relationships shows family members with wikilinks. Blocks can be frozen to static markdown via toolbar button.

- **Insert dynamic blocks** - Context menu actions and command palette command to insert dynamic blocks into existing person notes. Includes bulk insert for folders with progress indicator.

- **Dynamic blocks toggle in Create Person modal** - Option to include dynamic blocks when creating new person notes.

- **Dynamic blocks toggle in import wizards** - Option to include dynamic blocks in person notes during GEDCOM/Gramps/CSV import.

### Fixed

- **Family Chart zoom buttons causing NaN%** - Fixed issue where clicking zoom in/out buttons could show "NaN%" and cause the chart to vanish. The `manualZoom` function uses D3's `scaleBy` which multiplies the scale, so zoom in now uses 1.2 (20% larger) and zoom out uses 0.8 (20% smaller) instead of the incorrect additive values. Also added validation to detect invalid zoom state and reset to fit view if needed.

- **Family Chart showing wrong person** - Fixed "Open family chart" command showing a previously loaded person instead of the current note. Now correctly opens with the current note's person, or shows a person picker if no cr_id is found.

- **Family Chart opening in sidebar** - Fixed issue where the chart could open in the sidebar instead of the main workspace. The chart now prefers opening in the main workspace when launched from a person note.

---

## [0.12.7] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **Gramps source import** - Gramps XML import now creates source notes from `<sources>` and `<citations>` elements. Sources are linked to events via citation references. Includes repository metadata (`repository`, `repository_type`, `source_medium`), media reference handles for manual resolution (`gramps_media_refs`), and Gramps ID preservation (`gramps_handle`, `gramps_id`) for re-import scenarios.

- **Source property aliases** - Added source properties to the property alias system. Users can now customize property names for source notes (e.g., `creator` instead of `author`, `archive` instead of `repository`). Configure in Preferences → Property aliases → Source properties.

- **Gramps import progress indicator** - Gramps XML import now shows a progress modal with phase indicators and running statistics, matching the GEDCOM import experience.

- **Gramps import UI toggles** - Import options now use Obsidian-style toggles for "Create source notes", "Create place notes", and "Create event notes" with descriptions and destination folders.

- **Load testing tools** - Added parameterized GEDCOM generator (`gedcom-testing/generate-loadtest.js`) for creating test files of any size, performance testing documentation, and xxxlarge sample file (7,424 people) for stress testing.

### Changed

- **Unified Age formula in People base template** - Replaced separate `full_lifespan` and `age_now` formulas with a single intelligent `age` formula. Shows current age for living people, lifespan for deceased, and "Unknown" for people exceeding the configurable age threshold (set in Preferences → Privacy & Export). Living/Deceased view filters also use this threshold to categorize people without death dates.

### Fixed

- **Gramps XML import for compressed .gramps files** - Added support for importing gzip-compressed `.gramps` files exported from Gramps 6.x. The importer now automatically detects and decompresses gzip-compressed files. Previously, importing `.gramps` files would fail with "file does not appear to be a valid Gramps XML file" because the compressed binary data was not recognized as XML.

- **Family Chart "child has more than 1 parent" error** - Fixed crash when opening Family Chart after importing data with parent-child relationship inconsistencies. The chart now validates bidirectional relationships, only including children who explicitly reference the parent back. This handles cases where a parent's `child` field lists someone who doesn't list them as father/mother.

- **Family Chart refresh delay** - Removed unnecessary 2-second delay when chart updates from live note changes.

- **Duplicate relationship entries** - Added deduplication for `children_id` and `spouse_id` arrays to handle frontmatter with duplicate entries.

- **Duplicate child/children property after Gramps import** - Fixed inconsistent property naming where Gramps import created `child` property but bidirectional linking and data quality tools used `children`. All components now consistently use the canonical `child` property name for wikilinks (with `children_id` for cr_ids). Also fixed Gramps importer using `child_id` instead of `children_id`.

---

## [0.12.5] - 2025-12-14

### Added

- **Source Image Import Wizard** - New wizard in Sources tab (`Import` button) for bulk-importing source images. Parses filenames to extract metadata (surnames, years, record types, locations), shows confidence indicators, and creates source notes with media wikilinks attached. Supports multi-part document grouping for census pages and other multi-page records.

- **Source Media Linker Wizard** - New wizard in Sources tab (`Link` button) for attaching images to existing source notes that don't have media. Features smart suggestions with confidence scoring based on filename analysis, auto-selection of top matches, "+N more" badges showing alternative suggestions, and row highlighting for files needing manual selection.

- **Filename parser service** - New `ImageFilenameParser` service extracts metadata from common genealogy naming patterns (`surname_year_type`, `surname_given_byear_type`, descriptive names). Recognizes record type keywords (census, birth, death, marriage, military, immigration, obituary, etc.) and multi-part indicators (`_p1`, `_a`, `_page1`).

---

## [0.12.2] - 2025-12-14

### Fixed

- **Bases Lifespan formula error** - Fixed "Cannot find function 'year' on type Date" error in the Lifespan calculated property. Changed formula syntax from `.year()` method to `(date1 - date2).years.floor()` duration syntax which is correct for Obsidian Bases.

- **Bases Living/Deceased members views** - Fixed "Living members" and "Deceased members" views showing incorrect results when the `died` property exists but is empty. Changed filter from negation syntax to `isEmpty()` function which correctly handles both missing and empty property values. Added `name` to the view's `order` field so the Name column displays.

---

## [0.12.1] - 2025-12-14

### Changed

- **Family chart opens in main workspace** - "Open in family chart" now opens as a new tab in the main workspace instead of the sidebar, providing more screen space for viewing complex trees.

- **Context menu reorganization** - Moved "Open in family chart" into the "Generate tree" submenu for person notes, grouping all tree visualization options together. A separator distinguishes the interactive view from file-generating options.

### Fixed

- **cr_id prefix bug in context menu** - Fixed "Add essential place properties" and "Add essential event properties" context menu actions incorrectly adding `place_` or `event_` prefixes to generated cr_id values. The cr_type field already identifies the note type, so cr_id should be a plain UUID format.

- **Tree preview UI freeze on large trees** - Disabled tree preview for trees with more than 200 people to prevent UI freeze. Large trees show a notice with the count and recommendation to generate the canvas directly instead.

- **Canvas generation freeze on large trees** - Trees with more than 200 people now automatically use the D3 hierarchical layout instead of family-chart to prevent UI freeze. Spouse positioning may be less accurate for very large trees, but the canvas will generate successfully.

- **Canvas files not using configured folder** - Generated canvas files now correctly use the "Canvases folder" setting from Preferences. Previously, canvases were created in the vault root instead of the configured folder.

- **Excalidraw files created in wrong folder** - Exported Excalidraw files are now saved to the vault root instead of the source file's parent folder (e.g., People folder). This applies to canvas-to-Excalidraw exports, timeline exports, and person-to-Excalidraw exports.

---

## [0.12.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added

- **Calendarium integration (Phase 1)** - Charted Roots can now import calendar definitions from the [Calendarium](https://github.com/javalent/calendarium) plugin. When Calendarium is installed and enabled, an "Integrations" card appears in Control Center Preferences with a toggle to enable read-only calendar import. Imported calendars appear in the "From Calendarium" section of the Date Systems card and can be selected when creating events with fictional dates. This eliminates the need to manually recreate calendar systems that are already defined in Calendarium.

### Changed

- **Stricter ESLint rules** - Added `await-thenable`, `no-base-to-string`, `no-console`, `no-case-declarations`, and `no-constant-condition` rules. Fixed all violations across the codebase.

---

## [0.11.9] - 2025-12-13

### Fixed

- **GEDCOM import race condition with BidirectionalLinker** - Fixed race condition where the BidirectionalLinker would modify files during Phase 1 of import before Phase 2 could replace GEDCOM IDs with cr_ids. The linker is now suspended during import and resumed after completion.

- **GEDCOM import regex substring matching** - Fixed ID replacement where shorter IDs (e.g., `I2`) would match within longer IDs (e.g., `I27`), causing corrupt cr_id formats like `jvc-874-coq-7457`. Replacements are now sorted by length (descending) with lookahead assertions to prevent partial matches.

- **GEDCOM import children_id not replaced in Phase 2** - Fixed missing children_id replacement during relationship update phase. Child references from family records are now collected and replaced alongside parent/spouse IDs.

- **GEDCOM import duplicate name corruption** - Fixed post-import relationship sync corrupting data when importing files with duplicate names (e.g., two "John Smith" people). The sync matched by filename rather than cr_id, causing relationship data to merge incorrectly. GEDCOM data already contains complete bidirectional relationships, so the sync is now skipped.

- **Data quality: corrupt cr_id detection** - Added validation for cr_id format (xxx-123-xxx-123) in orphan reference checks. Invalid formats are now flagged as errors to catch import corruption.

---

## [0.11.8] - 2025-12-13

### Fixed

- **Base templates: columns not visible by default** - Fixed an issue where Obsidian Bases templates for Events, Sources, Organizations, and Places did not display columns by default. The templates had `sort` (which controls sorting direction) but were missing `order` (which controls visible columns). Added `order` arrays to the first view in each template specifying which columns to display.

- **Descendant tree canvas export missing edges** - Fixed a bug where descendant tree canvas exports had no connecting arrows between person cards. The `buildDescendantTree()` function was creating edges with `type: 'child'` which were filtered out by the canvas generator (which skips child edges to avoid duplicates). Changed edge type to `'parent'` so edges are properly included in the export.

---

## [0.11.7] - 2025-12-12

### Added

- **Context menu for person links in Parent claim conflicts** - Right-click on person names in the Parent claim conflicts table to open in new tab or new window.

---

## [0.11.6] - 2025-12-12

### Fixed

- **GEDCOM import: children_id not replaced with cr_id values** - Fixed missing `children_id` replacement logic in `gedcom-importer.ts` and incorrect field name (`child_id` instead of `children_id`) in `gedcomx-importer.ts`. Now all relationship ID fields are properly replaced during import.

---

## [0.11.5] - 2025-12-12

Obsidian plugin review fixes (Round 12) and GEDCOM import bug fix.

### Fixed

- **GEDCOM import: parent IDs not replaced for duplicate names** - Fixed an issue where `father_id`, `mother_id`, `spouse_id`, and `children_id` properties retained GEDCOM IDs (e.g., `I2060`) instead of being replaced with `cr_id` values when importing people with duplicate names. The issue occurred because the relationship update phase looked for files by regenerating the filename, which didn't account for numeric suffixes added to handle duplicates (e.g., `John Smith 1.md`). Now tracks actual file paths during creation and uses them for relationship updates. Fixed in all three importers: `gedcom-importer.ts`, `gedcom-importer-v2.ts`, and `gedcomx-importer.ts`.

### Changed

- **PR review compliance (Round 12)** - Addressed all required items from Obsidian plugin review:
  - Fixed 27 floating promises by adding `void` or `await` as appropriate
  - Fixed lexical declaration in case block by wrapping in braces
  - Fixed `element.style.visibility` usage to use `setCssStyles()` instead
  - Removed `async` keyword from 4 methods that didn't use `await`
  - Added defensive object handling in YAML serialization to prevent `[object Object]`
  - Analyzed 449 sentence case flags - all determined to be false positives (proper nouns, product names, already sentence case)

- **PR review optional items** - Cleaned up deprecated code:
  - Removed unused template exports (`BASE_TEMPLATE`, `PLACES_BASE_TEMPLATE`, `EVENTS_BASE_TEMPLATE`)
  - Replaced `Vault.delete()` with `FileManager.trashFile()` to respect user preferences
  - Removed unused variables and function definitions

---

## [0.11.4] - 2025-12-12

Obsidian plugin review fixes (Round 11) and bug fixes.

### Changed

- **PR review compliance** - Addressed all required and optional items from Obsidian plugin review:
  - Replaced direct `style.x =` assignments with `style.setProperty()` for CSP compliance
  - Wrapped async event handlers with `void (async () => {...})()` pattern to handle floating promises
  - Removed unused imports across the codebase

### Fixed

- **Person picker showing non-person notes** - Fixed the "Select person" modal (used when linking Father/Mother/Spouse in Create Person) incorrectly listing place, event, and source notes alongside person notes

- **Timeline callout vertical line alignment** - Fixed the vertical line in markdown timeline exports not aligning with the dot markers

- **People base showing non-person notes** - Fixed the "Create People base" template including place, event, and source notes in the family members view

- **Events base template not working** - Rewrote the Events base template to use correct Obsidian Bases syntax (matching the working People base template structure). Added formulas for date formatting and duration calculations

- **Improved "Create base" button descriptions** - Updated descriptions for People, Events, Places, and Sources base buttons to explain that users need to click "Properties" after creating to enable additional columns

### Docs

- **Guide tab cleanup guidance** - Added post-import cleanup content to the Guide tab:
  - New "After importing" card with quick 4-step workflow overview
  - Added "Post-import cleanup" to Key Concepts section
  - Added "Clean up data" to Common Tasks grid

- **Data Quality wiki** - Added "Post-Import Cleanup Workflow" section with recommended 8-step sequence and tool locations

- **Roadmap** - Added "Post-Import Cleanup Wizard" as high-priority planned feature

---

## [0.11.3] - 2025-12-12

GEDCOM Import: Pre-import data quality preview with place name standardization, plus Control Center UI consistency improvements.

### Added

- **GEDCOM import data quality preview** - New pre-import analysis step that catches issues before any files are created:
  - Detects date issues (death before birth, future dates, events before/after death)
  - Identifies relationship issues (gender/role mismatches, parent younger than child)
  - Flags orphan references to non-existent records
  - Shows data completeness issues (missing names, unknown sex, no dates)

- **Data Quality wiki page** - New comprehensive documentation covering all data quality tools, batch operations, and best practices

- **Comprehensive GEDCOM edge case test file** - New test file `gedcom-testing/gedcom-sample-medium-edge-cases.ged` with 50+ intentional data quality issues for stress testing:
  - Duplicate names without distinguishing data
  - Multiple parents claiming the same child
  - Impossible dates (death before birth, future dates, parent younger than child)
  - Sex/gender conflicts with family roles
  - Circular ancestry relationships
  - Orphan references to non-existent records
  - Special characters in names (Irish, Spanish, Chinese)
  - Date format variations (ABT, BEF, AFT, ranges, question marks like "1850?")
  - Place name variations, typos, and special characters
  - Source issues (duplicates, missing titles)
  - Family issues (empty families, multiple spouses)

- **Standardize place types modal** (Places tab) - New data quality tool to convert generic place types like "locality" to standard types (city, town, village)
  - Detects places with non-standard types from GEDCOM imports
  - Bulk actions to set all places to the same type
  - Individual type selection with one-click apply
  - Shows parent place context for better decision making

- **Place notes table open buttons** - Added separate buttons to open place notes in new tab or new window

### Changed

- **Places tab reorganization** - Reordered cards to prioritize actionable content: Data quality first, then Place notes table, then Statistics last
- **Place statistics card** - Now shows compact summary with collapsible detailed statistics (categories, top places, migration patterns)
- **Removed Referenced places card** - Consolidated into Data quality card's "Missing place notes" section to reduce redundancy

### Fixed

- **Tree output root person picker showing non-person notes** - Fixed person browser in Control Center > Tree output tab listing events, sources, and places instead of only person notes

- **Remove placeholder values treating empty/null as issues** - The batch operation now only flags actual placeholder text ("Unknown", "N/A", "???", etc.) and no longer treats null/undefined/empty properties as problems

- **Enrich place hierarchy modal preview list** - Modal now shows which places will be enriched before starting

- **Top-level places incorrectly listed as orphans** - Countries and regions without parents (Taiwan, South Korea, etc.) are no longer flagged for hierarchy enrichment

- **Duplicate place detection mismatch** - Data quality card count now matches what the merge modal actually finds

---

## [0.11.2] - 2025-12-11

  - **Folder autocomplete**: Folder settings suggest existing vault folders as you type
  - **Bidirectional navigation**: Links between Plugin Settings and Preferences tab for easy discovery
  - **Reduced duplication**: Canvas layout and folder settings consolidated in Preferences only
  - **Default change**: `primaryTypeProperty` now defaults to `cr_type` (avoids conflicts with other plugins)

- **GEDCOM import now adds `cr_type: person`** to imported person notes for consistent note type detection

- **`cr_type` now an essential property** - Added to Guide tab documentation, "Insert essential properties" context menu action, and base template filter for consistent note detection

### Fixed

- **Family chart view only showing ancestors** - Fixed issue where the interactive family chart only displayed the direct ancestral line instead of the complete tree
  - Chart now properly shows descendants, siblings, and in-laws
  - Root cause: missing bidirectional children relationships in data transformation

- **Places tab crash with non-string place values** - Fixed TypeError when place properties contain arrays or objects instead of strings

- **GEDCOM import nested arrays for wikilinks** - Fixed YAML serialization writing `[[place]]` as nested arrays; wikilink values are now properly quoted

- **Map view not showing markers** - Fixed map not recognizing flat coordinate properties (`coordinates_lat`, `coordinates_long`) written by geocoding; now supports nested, flat, and legacy coordinate formats

- **Bidirectional relationship validation** - Fixed false positives and persistence issues
  - Now validates parent sex matches expected parent type (male → father, female → mother)
  - Prevents incorrect fixes like setting female as father_id or male as mother_id
  - Resolves issue where spouses with children in their children_id array were incorrectly flagged
  - Fixed issue where automatic bidirectional linker was reverting batch fix changes
  - Batch fix operation now suspends automatic linking during updates to prevent interference

  - Explicitly shows which field will be modified (children_id, father_id, mother_id, spouse_id)
  - Includes context about existing relationship
  - Example: "Will add Aaron Seymour to Calvin Seymour's children_id (Aaron Seymour lists them as father)"

### Fixed

- **Remove empty/placeholder values** - Fixed false positives in preview modal

### Changed

- **GEDCOM Import: State Abbreviation Normalization**: US state abbreviations are now automatically expanded to full names during place import
  - Comma-separated: `Abbeville, SC, USA` → `Abbeville, South Carolina, USA`
  - Space-separated: `Abbeville SC` → `Abbeville, South Carolina`
  - Prevents duplicate place notes from being created during import

### Improved

- **Merge Duplicates - Pass 4**: Administrative divisions (County, Parish, etc.) are now separated from settlements before grouping
  - Prevents "Abbeville County" from being incorrectly grouped with "Abbeville" (the city)
  - Each category groups independently by base name

- **GEDCOM Import Type Inference**: Context-aware detection prevents mislabeling cities as counties

  - **Batch action links**: "Find all duplicates →" and similar links connect to existing modals
  - **Other tools section**: Non-issue actions (Geocode lookup, Standardize place names, Merge duplicates) moved to dedicated section below issues
  - **Progressive disclosure**: First two issue sections expanded by default; others collapsed
  - **Priority ordering**: Missing place notes sorted by reference count (most-referenced first)

- **Places Tab Workflow Order**: Reorganized Data Quality card to present tools in recommended workflow order
  1. Missing place notes → Create missing places
  2. Real places missing coordinates → Bulk geocode
  3. Orphan places → Enrich hierarchy (new)
  4. Duplicate names → Merge duplicates
  5. Name variations → Standardize names (moved from Other Tools)

  - Suggests the most complete note as canonical (based on parent, coordinates, type, references)
  - Merging updates person notes, re-parents child places, and moves duplicates to trash
  - Accessible via Places tab workflow (step 2) or command palette
  - Particularly useful after GEDCOM import when duplicates are common

- **Full Name Similarity Detection**: Duplicate detection now also groups places by normalized `full_name`
  - Catches duplicates like "Hartford, CT" and "Hartford, CT, USA" with different parents
  - Normalizes full names by removing common country suffixes (USA, United Kingdom, etc.)
  - Shows "similar full name" match reason in the UI

---

## [0.10.10] - 2025-12-07

### Fixed

- **Place Hierarchy Not Loading from GEDCOM Import**: Fixed parent-child relationships not being resolved for GEDCOM-imported places
  - Root cause: GEDCOM importer writes `parent: "[[ParentName]]"` but PlaceGraphService only checked `parent_place` and `parent_place_id`
  - Now supports `parent`, `parent_place`, and `parent_place_id` properties
