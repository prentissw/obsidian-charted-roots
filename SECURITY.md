## Data Privacy and Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

### Nature of Data Stored

Charted Roots handles **highly sensitive personally identifiable information (PII)** by design, including:

- **Full names** of individuals and family members
- **Birth and death dates**
- **Family relationships** (parents, children, spouses, custom relationships)
- **Organization memberships** (guilds, companies, political affiliations, etc.)
- **Place associations** (birthplaces, residences, historical locations)
- **GEDCOM/Gramps XML files** containing extensive genealogical data
- **Custom notes** about individuals
- **Potential additional PII** in linked Markdown files

**Important**: All data is stored **locally** in your Obsidian vault. The plugin does **not**:
- Transmit data over the network
- Connect to external services
- Upload information to cloud servers
- Share data with third parties

### Data Storage Locations

1. **Person Notes** (`.md` files)
   - Location: Anywhere in your vault (user-controlled)
   - Format: Markdown with YAML frontmatter
   - Contains: Names, dates, relationships, cr_id values

2. **Place Notes** (`.md` files)
   - Location: Anywhere in your vault (user-controlled)
   - Format: Markdown with YAML frontmatter
   - Contains: Location names, coordinates, historical associations

3. **Organization Notes** (`.md` files)
   - Location: Anywhere in your vault (user-controlled)
   - Format: Markdown with YAML frontmatter
   - Contains: Organization names, types, membership records

4. **Canvas Files** (`.canvas` files)
   - Location: Anywhere in your vault (user-controlled)
   - Format: JSON
   - Contains: Visual layout data, references to person/place/organization notes

5. **Plugin Settings** (`data.json`)
   - Location: `.obsidian/plugins/charted-roots/data.json`
   - Format: Plain text JSON (unencrypted)
   - Contains: Plugin configuration (node sizes, spacing, preferences)
   - Does NOT contain: Personal genealogical data

### Why Plain Text Storage?

1. **Obsidian Standard**: Follows Obsidian's markdown-first philosophy
2. **User Control**: Users maintain full ownership and control of their data
3. **Transparency**: No hidden or obfuscated data storage
4. **Portability**: Data can be easily backed up, migrated, or processed by other tools
5. **Mobile Compatibility**: Works across all Obsidian platforms

## Security Recommendations

### For Individual Users

1. **Vault Protection**
   - Use strong passwords/encryption for your vault
   - Enable Obsidian's vault encryption if available
   - Store your vault on encrypted storage devices
   - Limit physical access to devices containing your vault

2. **Sharing Considerations**
   - **Never** share your vault publicly without sanitizing PII first
   - Be extremely cautious about who has access to your vault
   - Consider using separate vaults for sensitive genealogical data vs. other notes
   - **Use privacy protection** when exporting GEDCOM files for sharing
   - Privacy protection replaces living persons' names with placeholders while preserving tree structure

3. **Cloud Sync and Backup**
   - Understand that cloud sync services (Obsidian Sync, Dropbox, etc.) will sync all PII
   - Ensure your cloud storage is properly secured with 2FA
   - Consider local-only vaults for highly sensitive family data
   - Encrypted cloud storage is strongly recommended

4. **Version Control (Git)**
   - **NEVER** commit genealogical vaults to public repositories
   - Use private repositories only if necessary
   - Consider adding person notes directory to `.gitignore`
   - Be aware that git history contains all previous versions of data

5. **GEDCOM Files**
   - GEDCOM files contain extensive PII about living and deceased individuals
   - Treat GEDCOM files with the same security as financial documents
   - Be cautious when importing GEDCOM files from untrusted sources
   - **Enable privacy protection** when exporting GEDCOM files for sharing
   - Living persons can be anonymized or excluded entirely from exports

### For Professional Genealogists

1. **Client Data**
   - Maintain separate vaults for each client
   - Never mix client data in shared vaults
   - Follow applicable data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
   - Obtain explicit consent before storing client family data

2. **Compliance**
   - This plugin does not provide GDPR/CCPA compliance features
   - Users are responsible for compliance with applicable regulations
   - Consider data retention policies for deceased individuals
   - Document your data handling procedures

3. **Data Anonymization**
   - **Enable privacy protection** for professional demonstrations and client presentations
   - Configure the age threshold to determine who is considered living
   - Choose display formats: "Living", "Private", initials, or exclude entirely
   - Export privacy protection creates shareable files while preserving tree structure
   - Use fictional data for public examples when privacy protection is insufficient

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Data Access Control

1. **Physical Security**: Secure devices containing your vault
2. **Account Security**: Use strong passwords for OS accounts
3. **Application Security**: Keep Obsidian and plugins updated
4. **Network Security**: Be cautious on public WiFi when accessing vaults

### Data Backup

1. **Regular Backups**: Maintain encrypted backups of your vault
2. **Backup Testing**: Periodically verify backup integrity
3. **Offsite Storage**: Consider encrypted offsite backup storage
4. **Backup Security**: Protect backups with same security as primary vault

### Data Lifecycle

1. **Data Collection**: Only include necessary PII
2. **Data Retention**: Consider retention policies for old data
3. **Data Deletion**: Securely delete data when no longer needed
4. **Data Migration**: Securely transfer data when changing systems

## Known Security Limitations

1. **No Built-in Encryption**: The plugin does not encrypt data (relies on Obsidian/OS)
2. **No Access Controls**: Anyone with vault access can view all data
3. **No Audit Logging**: The plugin does not log data access (but see Log Export Privacy below)
4. **Privacy Protection is Opt-in**: Users must manually enable privacy protection in settings
5. **Canvas Privacy Limitations**: See [Canvas Privacy Protection](#canvas-privacy-protection) for important limitations

- **GDPR** (EU): Right to be forgotten, data portability, consent requirements
- **CCPA** (California): Consumer privacy rights, data disclosure requirements
- **Other Regional Laws**: Consult local privacy regulations

### Ethical Genealogy

1. **Living Individuals**: Exercise caution when recording data about living persons
2. **Consent**: Consider obtaining consent before recording others' information
3. **Sensitive Information**: Handle adoptions, paternity, and medical data with care
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect cultural norms around family information
5. **Historical Context**: Be mindful of historical injustices in genealogical records

## Data Breach Response

If you suspect your vault containing family data has been compromised:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Disconnect the device from network
   - Change passwords for cloud sync services
   - Review access logs if available
   - Identify what data may have been exposed

2. **Assessment**:
   - Determine scope of exposure
   - Identify affected individuals
   - Consider legal notification requirements

3. **Mitigation**:
   - Create new vault with fresh data
   - Review and update security practices
   - Consider informing affected family members
   - Document the incident

## Privacy and Obfuscation Features

Charted Roots includes privacy protection capabilities designed to protect PII:

### Living Person Protection

- **Automatic detection**: Persons without death dates born within a configurable threshold (default: 100 years) are considered living
- **Display formats**: Choose how protected persons appear: "Living", "Private", initials, or hidden
- **Export protection**: Living persons can be automatically protected in GEDCOM, GEDCOM X, Gramps XML, and CSV exports
- **Manual override**: Use the `cr_living` frontmatter property to explicitly mark individuals as living (`true`) or deceased (`false`), overriding automatic detection

### Sensitive Field Redaction

Certain fields containing highly sensitive personal information are **always excluded** from exports, regardless of privacy settings:

- **SSN/Social Security Number**: `ssn`, `socialSecurityNumber`, `social_security_number`
- **National Identity Numbers**: `identityNumber`, `identity_number`

These fields are automatically redacted from all export formats (GEDCOM, GEDCOM X, Gramps XML, CSV) to prevent accidental disclosure.

### Export Privacy

- **Privacy-aware exports**: GEDCOM, GEDCOM X, Gramps XML, and CSV exports respect privacy settings
- **Configurable threshold**: Set the age threshold for automatic living person detection
- **Structure preservation**: Family relationships maintained even when names are protected
- **Multiple formats**: Privacy protection works across all export formats
- **Sensitive field redaction**: SSN and identity numbers are always excluded from exports

### Log Export Privacy

When sharing logs for debugging or support, PII is automatically protected:

- **Obfuscation enabled by default**: Log exports replace personal data with placeholders
- **What gets obfuscated**: Names → `[NAME-1]`, dates → `[DATE]`, years → `[YEAR]`, file paths → `/[FILE].md`, UUIDs → `[ID]`
- **Configurable**: Can be disabled in Settings → Logging when debugging privately
- **Non-destructive**: Original log data remains intact; obfuscation applies only to exports

### Canvas Privacy Protection

Canvas generation includes privacy protection options when enabled in the tree wizard:

- **Text node obfuscation**: Living persons shown as text nodes with obfuscated names (e.g., "Living", "Private", or initials)
- **Hidden option**: Exclude living persons entirely from generated canvas
- **Wikilinks preserved**: Text nodes include wikilinks for navigation back to original notes
- **Preview integration**: Wizard shows count of privacy-protected persons before generation

**Important limitations:**

| Limitation | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| File nodes reveal identity | When using 'file' format, filename in canvas JSON is visible to anyone viewing the `.canvas` file |
| Wikilinks in text nodes | Text nodes include `[[filename]]` wikilinks which contain the original person's filename |
| Canvas JSON not encrypted | Canvas files store all node data in plain JSON format |
| Generation-time only | Privacy applied when canvas is created; no runtime hooks available |
| Shared canvases | If you share a canvas file, recipients can see the underlying data |
| Edges preserved | Relationship edges remain, showing family structure |

**What this means:** Canvas privacy protection is designed for **reducing casual visibility** when viewing canvases, not for secure data protection. For maximum privacy:
- Use the "hidden" display format to exclude living persons entirely
- Do not share generated canvas files containing living persons
- Consider the underlying canvas JSON visible to anyone with file access

### Use Cases

- **GDPR Compliance**: Share historical research while protecting living EU residents' data
- **Public Genealogy**: Share complete historical trees while protecting recent generations
- **Professional Demonstrations**: Show family tree structures without exposing client PII
- **Educational Materials**: Create teaching examples protecting all living individuals
- **Collaborative Research**: Share tree structure with researchers who need patterns, not names
- **Bug Reports**: Share logs publicly without exposing family data

### Private Fields Protection

Mark specific fields as private using the `private_fields` frontmatter property:

- **User-defined list**: Specify which fields contain sensitive information
- **Export warnings**: Confirmation dialog shown before exporting private fields
- **Deadname protection**: Use `private_fields: [previous_names]` to protect previous names
- **Common use cases**: Medical notes, legal information, personal notes

**Example:**
```yaml
name: Alex Johnson
previous_names:
  - Alexandra Johnson
private_fields:
  - previous_names
```

### Privacy Feature Discoverability

Charted Roots helps users discover privacy features:

- **Import notification**: After importing data with potential living persons, a notice offers to configure privacy settings
- **Export warning**: When privacy protection is disabled, the export preview shows how many living persons will be exported with full details
- **One-click settings access**: Both notices link directly to privacy configuration

## Future Security Enhancements

Additional planned improvements:

- **Interactive family chart privacy**: Apply privacy protection to the family chart view
- **Report privacy**: Apply privacy protection to markdown/ODT/PDF reports
- **Runtime canvas obfuscation**: Temporary display mode toggle for screenshots/presentations
- Optional encryption for cr_id values
- Audit logging capabilities
- Access control recommendations
