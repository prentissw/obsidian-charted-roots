## Re-Layout Canvas Command (2025-11-21)

**Added:** Complete re-layout functionality for existing family tree canvases.

**Implemented Features:**

1. **Command Integration:**
   - Command Palette: "Re-layout current canvas"
   - Right-click menu on canvas files (file explorer, tab bar, three-dot menu)
   - Uses current plugin settings for spacing and node dimensions

2. **Smart Re-Layout Logic:**
   - Reads existing canvas JSON structure
   - Extracts person notes and relationships
   - Rebuilds family tree from current vault data
   - Recalculates positions using family-chart layout engine
   - Preserves Obsidian's exact JSON formatting

3. **Non-Destructive Updates:**
   - Updates canvas in-place (same file, same location)
   - Uses current relationship data from person notes
   - Applies current spacing/sizing settings
   - Shows success notification with person count

**Use Cases:**
- Update tree after editing relationships in person notes
- Apply new spacing settings to existing canvases
- Fix layout after data corrections
- Standardize multiple trees with consistent settings
- Refresh trees created with older layout algorithms
- Test different layout configurations

**Files Modified:**
- `main.ts` - Added `relayoutCanvas()` method (lines 165-310)
- `main.ts` - Added `formatCanvasJson()` helper (lines 321-358)
- `main.ts` - Added file-menu context integration
- `main.ts` - Added command registration
- `src/ui/relayout-options-modal.ts` - Modal for re-layout direction selection

**Technical Details:**
- Uses full tree generation (`treeType: 'full'`) to include all people in canvas
- Detects root person automatically (first person note with cr_id)
- Applies 100ms delay when opening canvas before re-layout
- Formats JSON with tabs and compact objects to match Obsidian format
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly notices

## Canvas Metadata & Smart Re-layout (2025-11-22)

**Added:** Embedded generation metadata in canvas files to enable intelligent re-layout with preserved settings.

**Implemented Features:**

1. **Canvas Generation Metadata:**
   - Stores complete generation parameters in canvas frontmatter
   - Metadata includes: root person (cr_id and name), tree type, max generations, spouse inclusion, layout direction, timestamp
   - Layout settings preserved: node dimensions, horizontal/vertical spacing
   - Metadata format compatible with Obsidian Canvas JSON specification

2. **Smart Re-Layout with Settings Preservation:**
   - Re-layout modal reads original generation settings from canvas metadata
   - Displays original settings to user: "Originally generated as 'full' tree from Thomas Wilson with direction: vertical"
   - Preserves all original settings (tree type, generations, spouses) when re-layouting
   - Only allows changing layout direction (vertical ↔ horizontal)
   - Maintains generation timestamp for tracking

3. **Metadata Infrastructure:**
   - `CanvasRootsMetadata` interface in canvas-generator.ts defines metadata schema
   - Metadata embedded in canvas JSON at generation time (both Control Center and Generate All Trees)
   - `formatCanvasJson()` methods properly serialize metadata to frontmatter
   - Re-layout reads metadata and passes to canvas generator to preserve settings

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/canvas-generator.ts` - Added `CanvasRootsMetadata` interface, metadata logging, metadata embedding in canvas output
- `src/ui/control-center.ts` - Added metadata to `handleTreeGeneration()` and `openAndGenerateAllTrees()`, fixed `formatCanvasJson()` to serialize frontmatter
- `main.ts` - Updated `relayoutCanvas()` to read and use stored metadata, fixed `formatCanvasJson()` to serialize frontmatter
- `src/ui/relayout-options-modal.ts` - Enhanced modal to read and display original generation settings from metadata

**Technical Details:**
- Metadata stored in standard Obsidian Canvas `metadata.frontmatter` field as `Record<string, unknown>`
- TypeScript literal types (`as const`) ensure type safety for fixed values like 'canvas-roots', 'full', 'vertical'
- Uses plugin's structured logging system (`getLogger('CanvasGenerator')`) instead of console.log
- Metadata passed through generation pipeline via `canvasRootsMetadata` option parameter
- JSON serialization via `JSON.stringify()` for nested metadata object

**Use Cases:**
- Preserve complex tree configurations when switching between vertical/horizontal layouts
- Track when and how each canvas was generated for audit trail
- Enable future "regenerate with same settings" functionality
- Support canvas versioning and migration in future updates

   - Uses BFS graph traversal via FamilyGraphService
   - Automatically detects disconnected family components
   - Dynamic message shows actual count: "Found 6 disconnected family groups"
   - "Generate all trees" auto-selects one representative per component

**Layout Before:**
- Root person field in Configuration card (modal picker)
- Configuration card (tree type, generations, spouses)
- Layout card (direction, spacing)
- Output card at bottom (canvas name, generate button) - easy to miss

**Layout After:**
- Root Person card (person display, inline browser, canvas name, both generate buttons)
- Tree Configuration card (tree type, generations, spouses)
- Layout Options card (direction, spacing)

**UX Benefits:**
- No modal switching required - entire workflow in one view
- Primary action impossible to miss (large button at top)
- Clear distinction between single-tree and multi-tree workflows
- Faster person selection with inline filtering
- Better understanding of vault structure via family group detection
