## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

Canvas Roots is an Obsidian plugin that automates the creation and layout of complex family trees within Obsidian Canvas, using structured note data as the source and D3.js-based layout algorithms for positioning.

### 1.2 Key Differentiators

- **Native Canvas Integration:** Renders family trees as native Obsidian Canvas nodes and edges, not embedded visualizations
- **D3.js Layout Engine:** Leverages powerful graph layout algorithms for automatic positioning
- **Full Customization:** Users can manually adjust any node after automatic layout
- **Bidirectional Linking:** Maintains relationship consistency across all person notes
- **GEDCOM Compatibility:** Import and export standard genealogical data formats

### 1.3 Core Workflow

```
User creates person notes with relationship links
           ↓
User runs "Generate Tree" command on Canvas
           ↓
Plugin calculates D3 layout coordinates
           ↓
Plugin renders nodes/edges to Canvas JSON
           ↓
User views and customizes the family tree
```

## 2. Data Model

### 2.1 Person Note Schema

Each person in the family tree is represented by an individual Markdown note with YAML frontmatter or inline fields (Dataview compatible).

#### 2.1.1 Core Properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `cr_id` | String (UUID) | **Yes** | Unique identifier for the person. Auto-generated on note creation. |
| `name` | String | No | Display name (defaults to file title) |
| `father` | [[Link]] | No | Link to father's note file |
| `mother` | [[Link]] | No | Link to mother's note file |
| `spouse` | [[Link]] or Array | No | Link(s) to spouse(s)/partner(s) |
| `children` | Array<[[Link]]> | No | Links to children's note files (auto-maintained by bidirectional linking) |
| `born` | Date | No | Birth date (see §6.4 for format details) |
| `died` | Date | No | Death date (see §6.4 for format details) |
| `cr_living` | Boolean | No | Explicitly mark if person is living (overrides auto-detection for obfuscation) |
| `cr_root` | Boolean | No | Marks person as tree center (optional filter) |
| `sex` | String | No | Biological sex (GEDCOM: M/F/U) for data compatibility and color coding |
| `gender` | String | No | Gender identity (free-form, e.g., "Woman", "Non-binary", "Transgender man") |
| `pronouns` | String | No | Preferred pronouns (e.g., "she/her", "they/them", "he/him") |
| `_previous_names` | Array<String> | No | Historical names (underscore prefix = private/sensitive data, see §2.1.2) |

#### 2.1.2 Privacy and Identity Protection

**Gender and Identity:** Canvas Roots respects the distinction between biological sex (relevant for GEDCOM data interchange and medical history) and gender identity (a person's authentic self-identification). The plugin supports both fields independently:

- **`sex`**: Used for GEDCOM compatibility and optional color coding in canvas visualizations. Supports standard GEDCOM values: M (male), F (female), U (unknown/unspecified). This field is optional and should reflect biological sex as recorded in genealogical records, not gender identity.
- **`gender`**: Free-form text field for recording gender identity. Examples: "Woman", "Man", "Non-binary", "Genderfluid", "Transgender woman", etc. This field takes precedence for display purposes and respectful language in UI.
- **`pronouns`**: Optional field for preferred pronouns to ensure respectful reference in documentation, exports, and custom reports.

**Visual Representation:** When color coding is enabled, the canvas generator uses the `sex` field by default for backward compatibility with GEDCOM data. Future versions will support user preference settings to color by `gender`, `sex`, or disable color coding entirely.

**Deadname Protection:** The `name` field always represents the person's current, chosen name. Historical names should **never** be displayed as the primary name. If historical names must be preserved for genealogical record-keeping:

- Use the `_previous_names` field (underscore prefix indicates private/sensitive data)
- The plugin **will not display** underscore-prefixed fields in UI, search results, or standard exports
- When exporting to GEDCOM or other formats, users will be warned if private fields are included
- Documentation and UI language will emphasize dignity and respect for chosen names

**Privacy Field Convention:** Any field prefixed with an underscore (`_`) is considered private or sensitive:

- **Never displayed** in person picker, search results, or canvas labels
- **Excluded by default** from exports and reports
- **Requires explicit user confirmation** if included in data exchange formats
- Examples: `_previous_names`, `_medical_notes`, `_adoption_details`

**Inclusive Language:** All documentation, UI text, and code comments use inclusive language that respects diverse gender identities and family structures. The plugin is designed to serve all users regardless of their gender identity, sexual orientation, or family composition.

#### 2.1.3 Extended Properties (See §6)

Additional properties for complex genealogical data:
- Multiple spouse tracking with metadata (§6.1)
- Alternative parent relationships (§6.2)
- Unknown parent markers (§6.3)
- Flexible date formats (§6.4)
- Child ordering fields (§6.5)
- Grandparent direct links (§6.7)
- Relationship quality metadata (§6.8)
- Medical and genetic information (§6.9)
- Location and migration tracking (§6.10)

#### 2.1.4 Reference Numbering Systems (Optional)

**Overview:** Reference numbering systems provide human-readable, hierarchical identifiers that encode genealogical relationships and positions within family trees. These complement the machine-level `cr_id` UUID system by offering intuitive labeling for research organization, file management, and print reports.

**Dual-Identity System:**

| Property | Purpose | Format | Example | Required |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| `cr_id` | Machine identity for merging, persistence, technical operations | UUID v4 | `abc-123-def-456` | Yes |
| `cr_ref_num` | Human-readable position for sorting, labeling, printing | System-dependent | `12.3`, `24.0*2`, `5/3.0` | No |

**Supported Systems:**

##### Dollarhide-Cole Numbering System

**Format:** `[tree_prefix/]number[.number]*[*marriage_order]`

**Key Components:**
- **Direct Ancestors:** End in `.0` (e.g., `12.0` = root's father)
- **Siblings:** Numbered `.1`, `.2`, `.3`, etc., based on birth order (eldest = `.1`)
- **Spouses:** Append `*` with marriage order (e.g., `12.3*2` = second spouse)
- **Descendants:** Append new number (e.g., `12.3` → first child is `12.3.1`)
- **Multiple Trees:** Use `/` separator (e.g., `5/3.0` = tree 5, person 3, direct ancestor)

**Birth Order Handling:**
- **Known order:** Use sequential numbers (`.1`, `.2`, `.3`)
- **Unknown order:** Use alphabetical by first name OR use `.u1`, `.u2`, `.u3` (unknown)
- **Twins/Multiples:** Same number with letter suffix (`.1a`, `.1b`) OR sequential if order is known

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Root person
---
cr_id: root-uuid
cr_ref_num: "1"
name: Starting Person
---

# Root's father (direct ancestor)
---
cr_id: father-uuid
cr_ref_num: "2.0"
name: Father of Root
---

# Root's mother (direct ancestor)
---
cr_id: mother-uuid
cr_ref_num: "3.0"
name: Mother of Root
---

# Root's eldest sibling
---
cr_id: sibling1-uuid
cr_ref_num: "1.1"
name: Eldest Sibling
---

# Root's second sibling (root is third child)
---
cr_id: sibling2-uuid
cr_ref_num: "1.2"
name: Second Sibling
---

# Root's first spouse
---
cr_id: spouse1-uuid
cr_ref_num: "1*1"
name: First Spouse
---

# Root's second spouse
---
cr_id: spouse2-uuid
cr_ref_num: "1*2"
name: Second Spouse
---

# Root's first child with first spouse
---
cr_id: child1-uuid
cr_ref_num: "1.1"
name: First Child
father: "[[Starting Person]]"  # cr_ref_num: "1"
mother: "[[First Spouse]]"     # cr_ref_num: "1*1"
---

# Grandchild (first child's eldest child)
---
cr_id: grandchild1-uuid
cr_ref_num: "1.1.1"
name: First Grandchild
---

# Multiple trees example: Second family tree, person 3, direct ancestor
---
cr_id: tree2-person-uuid
cr_ref_num: "2/3.0"
name: Person from Second Tree
---
```

**Canvas Display Integration:**

Reference numbers are displayed on canvas nodes when enabled:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ [12.3] John Robert Smith    │  ← Reference number in brackets
│ 1888-1952                   │
│                             │
│ Father: [24.0] John Sr      │
│ Mother: [25.0] Jane Doe     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Settings Configuration:**

```yaml
reference_numbering:
  enabled: true
  system: "dollarhide-cole"     # Options: "dollarhide-cole", "ahnentafel", "custom"

  root_person: "[[Starting Person]]"

  # Canvas display options
  display_on_canvas: true
  display_format: "[{ref_num}] {name}"  # Bracket style
  # OR: "{ref_num} - {name}"           # Dash style
  # OR: "{name} ({ref_num})"           # Parenthetical

  # File naming suggestions
  show_in_filename_suggestions: true
  filename_template: "{ref_num} - {name}.md"  # "12.3 - John Robert Smith.md"

  # Generation strategy
  auto_calculate: "suggest"     # Options: "manual", "suggest", "automatic"
  # "manual": User assigns all numbers manually
  # "suggest": Plugin suggests numbers, user can edit
  # "automatic": Plugin auto-assigns and updates

  # Birth order handling
  unknown_birth_order_strategy: "alphabetical"  # Options: "alphabetical", "unknown_suffix"
  # "alphabetical": Sort by first name (A=.1, B=.2, etc.)
  # "unknown_suffix": Use .u1, .u2, .u3 for unknown order

  # Multiple trees
  allow_multiple_trees: true
  tree_separator: "/"

  # Display preferences
  show_on_person_detail_panel: true
  editable_in_panel: true       # Allow editing ref_num in detail panel
```

##### Ahnentafel Numbering System

**Format:** Simple integer sequence based on mathematical relationship.

**Rules:**
- Root person: `1`
- Father of person `n`: `2n`
- Mother of person `n`: `2n + 1`

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Root
cr_ref_num: "1"

# Father
cr_ref_num: "2"

# Mother
cr_ref_num: "3"

# Paternal grandfather
cr_ref_num: "4"

# Paternal grandmother
cr_ref_num: "5"

# Maternal grandfather
cr_ref_num: "6"

# Maternal grandmother
cr_ref_num: "7"
```

**Advantages:** Mathematically predictable, compact for ancestor trees.

**Limitations:** Only works for direct ancestors (no siblings, descendants, or spouses).

##### Custom Numbering Systems

**Format:** User-defined pattern.

**Configuration:**

```yaml
reference_numbering:
  system: "custom"
  custom_pattern: "{generation}-{family_line}-{individual}"
  # Example: "G3-Smith-001"
```

**Use Cases:**
- Institutional archives (e.g., `ARCH-FAM-001`)
- Research projects with specific naming conventions
- Integration with existing paper-based filing systems

#### GEDCOM Export Integration

Reference numbers are exported using the standard `REFN` (Reference Number) tag:

```gedcom
0 @I001@ INDI
1 _UUID abc-123-def-456
1 REFN 12.3
2 TYPE Dollarhide-Cole
1 NAME John Robert /Smith/
1 BIRT
2 DATE 15 MAY 1888
```

**On Import:** If a GEDCOM file contains `REFN` tags, the plugin offers to:
1. Import reference numbers as-is
2. Recalculate based on selected system and root person
3. Ignore reference numbers

#### Generation and Calculation

**Automatic Calculation Triggers:**
- New person note created with relationship to existing person
- Relationship fields modified (father, mother, spouse, child)
- Root person changed in settings
- User runs "Recalculate Reference Numbers" command

**Calculation Algorithm (Dollarhide-Cole):**

1. Start from root person (ref_num = "1")
2. Traverse relationships depth-first
3. For each person:
   - If direct ancestor: append `.0`
   - If sibling: append `.1`, `.2`, etc. based on birth order
   - If spouse: append `*1`, `*2`, etc. based on marriage order
   - If descendant: append new generation number
4. Handle cycles by detecting already-numbered persons
5. Mark conflicts for manual resolution

**Edge Cases:**

- **Multiple paths to same person:** Use shortest path OR path through root's direct lineage
- **Missing birth dates:** Use alphabetical order or unknown suffix
- **Disconnected persons:** Assign new tree prefix (e.g., `2/1`) OR leave unnumbered
- **Cycles in relationships:** Detect and warn user, prevent infinite loops

#### User Interface

**Commands:**
- `Canvas Roots: Assign Reference Numbers` - Calculate for entire vault
- `Canvas Roots: Recalculate Reference Numbers` - Recalculate based on current settings
- `Canvas Roots: Clear Reference Numbers` - Remove all `cr_ref_num` properties
- `Canvas Roots: Set Root Person for Reference Numbering` - Choose new root

**Detail Panel Integration:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Person Details                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Reference Number: [12.3    ] [↻]   │  ← Editable with recalculate button
│ UUID: abc-123-def-456               │
│ Name: John Robert Smith             │
│ ...                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**File Renaming Suggestions:**

When `show_in_filename_suggestions: true`, the plugin suggests renaming files based on reference numbers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Reference Number Updated                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ John Robert Smith.md → 12.3 - John Robert Smith.md │
│                                                 │
│ [Skip]  [Rename This File]  [Rename All (23)]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Use Cases

**Research Organization:**
- Sort person notes by reference number to mirror printed genealogy charts
- Quickly identify generation and family line from filename
- Maintain consistent numbering across digital and paper records

**Print Reports:**
- Export family trees with reference numbers matching professional genealogy standards
- Create indexes and tables of contents using reference numbers
- Cross-reference between narrative reports and charts

**Collaborative Research:**
- Share consistent person identifiers with research partners
- Reference specific individuals in correspondence without ambiguity
- Maintain numbering across multiple researchers' vaults (when using same root and system)

**File Management:**
- Organize hundreds of person notes with hierarchical file naming
- Sort files to keep family groups together
- Quickly locate individuals by position in tree (e.g., "I need the 3rd child of person 12")

**Canvas Navigation:**
- Quickly identify person's position in tree at a glance
- Use reference numbers as visual anchors when zooming/panning large trees
- Filter canvas to show only specific number ranges (e.g., "show me generation 3: all .x.x.x")

#### Implementation Priority

Reference numbering systems are planned for **Phase 2** (enhancement features), after core tree generation and layout are stable.

### 2.2 Bidirectional Link Automation

**Requirement:** The plugin must automatically maintain inverse relationships when primary relationships are created or modified.

**Examples:**
- When `father: [[John Smith]]` is added to Jane's note → ensure `children: [[Jane Doe]]` exists in John's note
- When `spouse: [[Jane Doe]]` is added to John's note → ensure `spouse: [[John Smith]]` exists in Jane's note

**Implementation:** This feature is part of the MVP and must be implemented before 1.0 release.

**Validation:**
- Review all person data in structured format
- Identify missing or incorrect information
- Fix broken relationships

### 3.4 Collections and Dataset Management

**Requirement:** Enable users to organize, browse, and work with multiple family trees and research projects within a single vault, supporting both automatic detection and optional manual organization.

> **Note:** For complete architectural details, see [docs/architecture/collections.md](../architecture/collections.md)

#### 3.4.1 Overview

**Purpose:**
- Automatically detect and work with multiple disconnected family trees (zero configuration)
- Optionally organize person notes into user-defined collections
- Switch between different datasets seamlessly
- Track family component statistics
- Support both genealogy and world-building use cases

**Design Philosophy:**

Canvas Roots uses a **Smart Hybrid Approach** with two parallel collection systems:

1. **Detected Components** (automatic, zero-config)
   - Computed from relationship graph using BFS traversal
   - Works for all users regardless of vault organization
   - No folders, tags, or configuration required
   - Self-healing (always reflects current relationship data)

2. **User Collections** (optional, manual)
   - User-assigned collection property in person note frontmatter
   - For power users who want custom organization
   - Works alongside detected components
   - Stored as simple YAML property

**Key Constraint:** Many Obsidian users do not use folders or tags, and do not wish to. Canvas Roots must work perfectly for flat vaults with zero configuration.

#### 3.4.2 Detected Family Components

**What Are Detected Components?**

Family components are disconnected graphs discovered by analyzing relationships between person notes. If two people have no path of relationships connecting them, they belong to different components.

**Data Model:**

```typescript
/**
 * A detected family component (computed, not stored)
 */
export interface FamilyComponent {
  // Component index (0-based, sorted by size descending)
  index: number;  // 0, 1, 2...

  // Display name from user-provided group_name or auto-generated
  displayName: string;  // "Smith Family Tree" or "Family 1"

  // Number of people in this component
  size: number;

  // All people in this component
  people: PersonNode[];

  // Representative person (oldest by birth, or first alphabetically)
  representative: PersonNode;
}
```

**Detection Algorithm:**

```typescript
class FamilyGraphService {
  /**
   * Detect all family components using BFS graph traversal
   * @returns Components sorted by size (largest first)
   */
  async getFamilyComponents(): Promise<FamilyComponent[]> {
    // Use existing findAllFamilyComponents() implementation
    const components = await this.findAllFamilyComponents();

    return components.map((comp, index) => {
      // Look for user-provided custom name
      const customName = this.findCollectionName(comp.people);

      return {
        index,
        displayName: customName || `Family ${index + 1}`,
        size: comp.size,
        people: comp.people,
        representative: comp.representative
      };
    });
  }

  private findCollectionName(people: PersonNode[]): string | null {
    // Scan frontmatter for group_name property
    const names = people
      .map(p => this.getPropertyFromFrontmatter(p.file, 'group_name'))
      .filter(n => n);

    if (names.length === 0) return null;
    if (names.length === 1) return names[0];

    // Multiple names - pick most common or first alphabetically
    const counts = names.reduce((acc, name) => {
      acc[name] = (acc[name] || 0) + 1;
      return acc;
    }, {} as Record<string, number>);

    return Object.keys(counts)
      .sort((a, b) => counts[b] - counts[a] || a.localeCompare(b))[0];
  }
}
```

**YAML Properties for Naming:**

Users can optionally name their family components by adding `group_name` to person notes:

```yaml
---
cr_id: "abc-123"
name: "John Smith"
group_name: "Smith Family Tree"  # Optional component name
---
```

**Naming Rules:**
- If no one in component has `group_name`: Auto-generate "Family 1", "Family 2", etc.
- If 1+ people have same `group_name`: Use that name
- If people have different names: Use most common, break ties alphabetically

**Key Property: Component Membership is COMPUTED**

Component membership is **never stored** in person notes. It is always derived from current relationships by running BFS traversal.

**Why?**
- Prevents stale data (always reflects current relationships)
- Zero maintenance (no manual updating needed)
- Self-healing (adding/removing relationships automatically updates components)
- Obsidian Bases compatible (users can edit relationships, components recompute)

**How Users Control Component Membership:**

Users control which component a person belongs to by **editing their relationships**, not by editing a stored component ID:

```yaml
# To move "Sarah Jones" from Family 1 to Family 2:
# 1. Remove relationships connecting her to Family 1 members
# 2. Add relationships connecting her to Family 2 members
# 3. Components recompute automatically on next access
```

#### 3.4.3 User Collections (Optional)

**What Are User Collections?**

User collections are optional, user-defined groupings stored in person note frontmatter. They provide an additional organizational layer for power users.

**Data Model:**

```typescript
/**
 * A user-defined collection (stored in frontmatter)
 */
export interface UserCollection {
  // Collection name from 'collection' property
  name: string;  // "Paternal Line", "House Stark", etc.

  // All people with this collection value
  people: PersonNode[];
}

/**
 * Person node with optional collection assignment
 */
export interface PersonNode {
  crId: string;
  name: string;
  // ... existing fields ...

  // Optional user-assigned collection
  userCollection?: string;  // From 'collection' property
}
```

**YAML Property:**

```yaml
---
cr_id: "abc-123"
name: "John Smith"
collection: "Paternal Line"  # Optional user collection
---
```

**Use Cases:**

1. **Genealogy:** Organize by research focus
   - `collection: "Paternal Line"`
   - `collection: "Maternal Line"`
   - `collection: "Colonial Massachusetts"`

2. **World-Building:** Organize by faction/house
   - `collection: "House Stark"`
   - `collection: "Night's Watch"`
   - `collection: "Wildlings"`

**Relationship to Detected Components:**

User collections and detected components are **independent**:

```
Example vault:
- Detected Components: [Family 1 (8 people), Family 2 (5 people)]
- User Collections: [Paternal Line (6 people), Maternal Line (7 people)]

Family 1 members might be split across both user collections
User collection members might be split across multiple family components
```

**Obsidian Bases Integration:**

The `collection` property appears as an editable text field in Bases table view:

| name | cr_id | collection | born |
|------|-------|------------|------------|
| John Smith | abc-123 | Paternal Line | 1950-05-10 |
| Mary Jones | def-456 | Maternal Line | 1952-08-15 |

Users can bulk-edit collections using Bases drag-down fill or find-replace.

#### 3.4.4 Cross-Collection Connections

**Detected Components:**

By definition, detected components are disconnected (no relationship path between them). If relationships exist between two components, they merge into one component.

**User Collections:**

User collections can have connections via "bridge people" with cross-collection relationships:

```typescript
/**
 * Connection between two user collections
 */
export interface CollectionConnection {
  fromCollection: string;  // "House Stark"
  toCollection: string;    // "House Targaryen"
  bridgePeople: PersonNode[];  // People with relationships to both
  relationshipCount: number;   // Total cross-collection relationships
}
```

**Detection Algorithm:**

```typescript
async findCollectionConnections(): Promise<CollectionConnection[]> {
  const connections: Map<string, CollectionConnection> = new Map();

  for (const person of this.getAllPeople()) {
    const personCollection = person.userCollection;
    if (!personCollection) continue;

    // Check all relationships for cross-collection links
    for (const relationship of this.getAllRelationships(person)) {
      const relatedCollection = relationship.target.userCollection;

      if (relatedCollection && relatedCollection !== personCollection) {
        const key = [personCollection, relatedCollection].sort().join('|');

        if (!connections.has(key)) {
          connections.set(key, {
            fromCollection: personCollection,
            toCollection: relatedCollection,
            bridgePeople: [],
            relationshipCount: 0
          });
        }

        const conn = connections.get(key)!;
        if (!conn.bridgePeople.find(p => p.crId === person.crId)) {
          conn.bridgePeople.push(person);
        }
        conn.relationshipCount++;
      }
    }
  }

  return Array.from(connections.values());
}
```

**Use Case: Political Alliances (World-Building)**

```yaml
# Sansa Stark marries Tyrion Lannister
---
name: "Sansa Stark"
collection: "House Stark"
spouses:
  - "[[Tyrion Lannister]]"
---

# Tyrion Lannister
---
name: "Tyrion Lannister"
collection: "House Lannister"
spouses:
  - "[[Sansa Stark]]"
---
```

This creates a cross-collection connection:
- From: House Stark
- To: House Lannister
- Bridge people: [Sansa Stark, Tyrion Lannister]
- Relationship count: 1 (marriage)

#### 3.4.5 Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Component Naming (v0.2.0-beta)**

**Status:** Planned for next release

**Scope:**
- Add `group_name` property support
- Update UI to show custom names instead of "Family 1", "Family 2"
- Naming conflict resolution (most common name wins)
- Documentation for users

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Detected components continue to work as-is
- Custom names are optional enhancement
- Zero configuration still works perfectly

---

**Phase 2: User Collections (v0.3.0-beta)**

**Status:** Planned

**Scope:**
- Add `collection` property support
- UI to filter/browse by user collection
- Collection statistics in Status tab
- Obsidian Bases integration testing
- Cross-collection connection detection

**Features:**
- Filter person picker by collection
- "Collection:" dropdown in tree generation
- Statistics: "Paternal Line: 45 people across 2 family components"
- Bases template includes `collection` column

---

**Phase 3: Advanced Collection Features (v1.x.x)**

**Status:** Future

**Scope:**
- Cross-collection tree generation (show relationships between collections)
- Collection-level GEDCOM export (export only one collection)
- Collection merge/split tools
- Collection-specific styling (color-code nodes by collection)
- Reference numbering with collection codes (§2.1.4)

#### 3.4.6 UI Integration

**Current UI (v0.1.1):**

Tree Generation tab already shows detected components in sidebar:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tree Generation                          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ┌─────────┬──────────────────────────┐  │
│ │ All     │ Root person:             │  │
│ │ families│ [Select person...     ▼] │  │

│ └─────────┴──────────────────────────┘  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Phase 1 Enhancement:**

Show custom names when `group_name` is present:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tree Generation                          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ┌──────────────┬───────────────────────┐ │

│ └──────────────┴───────────────────────┘ │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Phase 2 Enhancement:**

Add collection filter dropdown:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tree Generation                          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Filter by:                               │
│ ○ Family component  [Smith Family     ▼] │
│ ○ User collection   [Paternal Line    ▼] │
│ ○ All people                             │
│                                          │
│ Root person:                             │
│ [Select person...                     ▼] │
│                                          │
│ • John Smith (1950)                      │
│ • Mary Jones (1952)                      │
│ • Robert Smith (1975)                    │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 3.4.7 Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Zero Configuration (Current)**

A user with a flat vault and no folder/tag organization:
1. Import GEDCOM (creates person notes in default folder)
2. Plugin automatically detects 3 disconnected family components
3. UI shows "Family 1 (12 people)", "Family 2 (8 people)", "Family 3 (5 people)"
4. User can immediately generate trees for each component
5. No configuration, naming, or organization required

**Use Case 2: Custom Component Names (Phase 1)**

A genealogist researching two main family lines:
1. Add `group_name: "Smith Paternal Line"` to Smith family members
2. Add `group_name: "Jones Maternal Line"` to Jones family members
3. UI updates to show custom names instead of "Family 1", "Family 2"
4. Person notes remain in flat structure (no folders required)

**Use Case 3: User Collections for Research Focus (Phase 2)**

A researcher organizing by research focus:
1. Assign `collection: "Primary Research"` to actively researched people
2. Assign `collection: "Verified"` to fully documented people
3. Assign `collection: "Needs Sources"` to people requiring citation work
4. Filter person picker by collection to focus work
5. Generate trees showing only "Needs Sources" people

**Use Case 4: World-Building with Noble Houses (Phase 2)**

A fiction writer organizing a fantasy world:
1. Create people for House Stark, House Lannister, House Targaryen
2. Assign `collection: "House Stark"`, etc. to each person
3. All houses might be one detected component (if marriages connect them)
4. But user collections provide faction-based organization
5. Generate "House Stark" tree, "House Lannister" tree, or combined tree
6. Plugin detects cross-collection marriages as political alliances

**Use Case 5: Obsidian Bases Bulk Editing (Phase 2)**

A user managing large datasets:
1. Open person notes in Bases table view
2. See `collection` column (text field)
3. Use Bases features: sort, filter, drag-down fill, find-replace
4. Bulk-assign collections to 50+ people in seconds
5. Canvas Roots respects all changes (collections are just YAML properties)
6. Generate trees with updated collection assignments

### 3.5 Tree Visualization Modes

**Requirement:** Provide dual-mode visualization supporting both interactive D3 preview and native Obsidian Canvas rendering with full editing capabilities.

#### 3.5.1 Overview

**Purpose:**
- Enable rapid iteration and exploration using D3 interactive preview
- Generate final trees to native Obsidian Canvas for full editability
- Provide seamless transition between preview and Canvas modes
- Maintain WYSIWYG consistency (preview matches Canvas output)

**Design Philosophy:**
- D3 mode = fast, interactive, read-only preview for layout refinement
- Canvas mode = native Obsidian Canvas with full editing capabilities
- Shared layout engine ensures consistency between modes

#### 3.5.2 Visualization Modes

**Mode 1: D3 Interactive Preview (Tree View)**

A custom Obsidian view type for interactive tree exploration:

```typescript
// View registration
this.registerView(
  TREE_VIEW_TYPE,
  (leaf) => new TreeView(leaf, this)
);

// View state
interface TreeViewState {
  collection: string;  // Collection ID
  tree: string;        // Tree ID
  rootPerson: string;  // cr_id of root
  layoutOptions: LayoutOptions;
}
```

**Features:**
- Full-screen D3 SVG rendering
- Interactive zoom/pan
- Click to select nodes
- Hover for quick info
- Real-time layout adjustment with settings panel
- "Export to Canvas" button
- **Read-only** (does not modify source notes or Canvas files)

**UI Structure:**

```

**Commands:**
- `Canvas Roots: Open Tree View` - Opens Tree View for active person note
- `Canvas Roots: Open Tree View for Collection` - Shows collection picker first

**Mode 2: Native Canvas View**

Standard Obsidian Canvas with optional Canvas Roots enhancements:

**Option A: Pure Canvas (Minimal Enhancement)**

User works with standard `.canvas` files:
- Open any `.canvas` file normally in Obsidian
- All native Canvas features available
- Canvas Roots adds commands to generate/re-layout trees
- No custom UI wrapper needed

**Commands:**
- `Canvas Roots: Generate Tree to Canvas` - Writes tree to active Canvas
- `Canvas Roots: Re-Layout Canvas` - Recalculates positions for existing nodes

**Option B: Enhanced Canvas View (Future)**

Custom leaf view that wraps native Canvas with dataset browser:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Canvas Roots: Smith-Main-Tree.canvas                [⚙️] │
├──────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┤

│ · John Smith │                                          │
└──────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Important:** The Canvas area is **native Obsidian Canvas**, not a custom renderer. All standard Canvas features work exactly as expected:
- Full editing capabilities
- All native Canvas interactions
- Standard Canvas file format
- Compatible with other Canvas plugins
- Canvas Roots only adds optional UI wrapper and commands

#### 3.5.3 Shared Layout Engine

Both visualization modes use the **same layout calculation engine** to ensure WYSIWYG consistency:

```typescript
// src/core/layout-engine.ts

export class LayoutEngine {
  /**
   * Calculate node positions using D3 algorithms
   * Used by both D3 preview and Canvas generation
   */
  calculateLayout(
    graph: FamilyGraph,
    options: LayoutOptions
  ): LayoutResult {
    // D3 tree/hierarchy calculations
    // Returns coordinates for all nodes
    // Same algorithm used for preview and Canvas output
  }
}

// Usage in D3 preview
const layout = layoutEngine.calculateLayout(graph, options);
d3Renderer.renderToSVG(layout);  // Draw to SVG

// Usage in Canvas generation
const layout = layoutEngine.calculateLayout(graph, options);
canvasGenerator.writeToCanvas(layout);  // Write to .canvas JSON
```

**Benefit:** What user sees in D3 preview is **exactly** what will be generated to Canvas.

#### 3.5.4 Canvas File Metadata

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (2025-11-22)

Canvas files generated by Canvas Roots include embedded metadata in the standard Obsidian Canvas `metadata.frontmatter` field. This enables intelligent re-layout with preserved settings.

**Implemented Format:**

```json
{
  "nodes": [ /* ... canvas nodes ... */ ],
  "edges": [ /* ... canvas edges ... */ ],
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0-1.0",
    "frontmatter": {
      "plugin": "canvas-roots",
      "generation": {
        "rootCrId": "vvz-870-oee-253",
        "rootPersonName": "Thomas Wilson",
        "treeType": "full",
        "maxGenerations": 5,
        "includeSpouses": true,
        "direction": "vertical",
        "timestamp": 1763832272682
      },
      "layout": {
        "nodeWidth": 200,
        "nodeHeight": 100,
        "nodeSpacingX": 300,
        "nodeSpacingY": 200
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Metadata Schema (`CanvasRootsMetadata`):**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `plugin` | `'canvas-roots'` | Plugin identifier for metadata validation |
| `generation.rootCrId` | `string` | Root person's cr_id |
| `generation.rootPersonName` | `string` | Root person's display name |
| `generation.treeType` | `'full' \| 'ancestors' \| 'descendants'` | Type of tree generated |
| `generation.maxGenerations` | `number` | Generation limit (0 = unlimited) |
| `generation.includeSpouses` | `boolean` | Whether spouses were included |
| `generation.direction` | `'vertical' \| 'horizontal'` | Layout direction |
| `generation.timestamp` | `number` | Unix timestamp of generation |
| `layout.nodeWidth` | `number` | Canvas node width in pixels |
| `layout.nodeHeight` | `number` | Canvas node height in pixels |
| `layout.nodeSpacingX` | `number` | Horizontal spacing between nodes |
| `layout.nodeSpacingY` | `number` | Vertical spacing between nodes |

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Re-layout command preserves tree type, generations, and spouse inclusion settings
- ✅ Re-layout modal displays original generation settings to user
- ✅ Enables changing layout direction while preserving all other settings
- ✅ Audit trail with generation timestamp
- ✅ Compatible with Obsidian Canvas JSON specification
- ✅ Future-proof for canvas versioning and migration

**Implementation Details:**
- Metadata embedded at generation time in both Control Center and "Generate All Trees" command
- Stored in standard Obsidian Canvas `metadata.frontmatter` field as `Record<string, unknown>`
- TypeScript interface `CanvasRootsMetadata` defines schema in `src/core/canvas-generator.ts`
- Re-layout reads metadata and passes to canvas generator via `canvasRootsMetadata` option
- Uses TypeScript literal types (`as const`) for type safety

#### 3.5.5 Mode Switching Workflow

**Primary Workflow: Preview → Canvas**

```
1. User opens Control Center
2. Selects collection and tree
3. Clicks "Preview Tree" → Opens D3 Tree View
4. Adjusts layout settings with real-time preview
5. Satisfied with layout
6. Clicks "Generate to Canvas"
7. Plugin writes to .canvas file
8. Opens Canvas in native Obsidian Canvas view
9. User manually edits as needed
```

**Secondary Workflow: Direct to Canvas**

```
1. User opens person note
2. Runs command: "Generate Tree to Canvas"
3. Plugin uses default settings
4. Writes directly to .canvas file
5. No preview step needed
```

**Re-Layout Workflow:**

```
1. User has existing .canvas file with tree
2. Made manual adjustments to node positions
3. Wants to restore calculated layout
4. Runs command: "Re-Layout Canvas"
5. Plugin reads canvas-roots metadata
6. Recalculates layout with original settings
7. Updates node positions
8. User can manually adjust again
```

#### 3.5.6 Implementation Components

**Core Classes:**

```typescript
// D3 rendering for preview
export class D3TreeRenderer {
  renderToSVG(container: HTMLElement, layout: LayoutResult): void;
  updateLayout(layout: LayoutResult): void;  // Live updates
  destroy(): void;
}

// Canvas file generation
export class CanvasGenerator {
  writeToCanvas(
    canvasPath: string,
    layout: LayoutResult,

   │ • Undirected (—) - No arrows        │
   └─────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

**Arrow Style Modes:**

| Style | Visual | Use Case |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Directed** | `→` | Default for parent-child relationships. Arrow points from parent to child, showing generational flow. |
| **Bidirectional** | `↔` | Arrows on both ends. Useful for emphasizing reciprocal relationships or spouse connections. |
| **Undirected** | `—` | Just lines, no arrows. Default for spouse relationships. Creates cleaner look when direction isn't meaningful. |

**JSON Canvas Compliance:**

Arrow styling uses the JSON Canvas 1.0 spec's `fromEnd` and `toEnd` properties:
- `fromEnd`: `'none'` or `'arrow'` (start of edge)
- `toEnd`: `'none'` or `'arrow'` (end of edge)

**Defaults:**
- Parent-child: Directed (`fromEnd: 'none'`, `toEnd: 'arrow'`)
- Spouse: Undirected (`fromEnd: 'none'`, `toEnd: 'none'`)

##### Data Entry Tab

   **Current Implementation (v1.8):**
   - Gender-based coloring using sex/gender field from frontmatter
   - Male persons: Canvas color 4 (Green)
   - Female persons: Canvas color 6 (Purple)
   - Unknown gender: Canvas color 2 (Orange)
   - Parent-child edges: Canvas color 1 (Red)
   - Spouse edges: Canvas color 5 (Blue)
   - Automatically reads `sex` or `gender` field from YAML frontmatter
   - Standard GEDCOM values supported: M, F, U (male, female, unknown)

##### Properties Tab (Phase 2)

**Purpose:** Configure custom property names for person note YAML frontmatter

**Rationale:**
- **Migration:** Adapt to existing vaults with different property naming conventions
- **Localization:** Support non-English genealogy workflows
- **Flexibility:** Allow users to choose their own naming preferences
- **Compatibility:** Enable custom namespacing or integration with other systems

**Default Property Names (GEDCOM-Compatible):**

The plugin ships with GEDCOM-compatible property names:

```yaml
# Standard genealogy properties (no prefix)
name: "John Robert Smith"
father: "cr-id-123"      # or "[[Father Name]]" for legacy
mother: "cr-id-456"      # or "[[Mother Name]]" for legacy
spouse: "cr-id-789"      # or ["cr-id-789", "cr-id-012"] for multiple
children: ["cr-id-345", "cr-id-678"]
born: "1888-05-15"
died: "1952-08-20"

# Canvas Roots-specific properties (cr_ prefix)
cr_id: "abc-123-def-456"
cr_living: true
cr_root: true
cr_ref_num: "12.3"
```

  born: string;          // default: "born"
  died: string;          // default: "died"

  // Canvas Roots properties
  crId: string;          // default: "cr_id"
  crLiving: string;      // default: "cr_living"
  crRoot: string;        // default: "cr_root"
  crRefNum: string;      // default: "cr_ref_num"
}

// Plugin settings
export interface CanvasRootsSettings {
  propertyNames: PropertyNameConfig;
  // ... other settings
}
```

**Use Cases:**

1. **Existing Vault Migration:**
   - User has existing notes with custom property names
   - Configure Properties tab to match existing convention
   - Or use migration tool to standardize to Canvas Roots defaults (`born`, `died`)

2. **Localization:**
   - German user prefers `geboren` (born), `gestorben` (died)
   - Configure property names to match language preference
   - Maintain GEDCOM compatibility via export mapping

3. **Multi-System Integration:**
   - User imports from Gramps (uses `birth_date`, `death_date`)
   - Configure Canvas Roots to read Gramps property names
   - Export to GEDCOM using standard mapping

4. **Custom Namespacing:**
   - User has multiple genealogy systems in same vault
   - Add custom prefix: `canvasroots_father`, `canvasroots_mother`
   - Avoid conflicts with other property sets

**MVP Implementation:**
- Property name configuration UI
- Live validation
- Reset to defaults buttons
- Settings persistence

**Phase 2 Enhancements:**
- Migration tools (dry run, backup, bulk rename)
- Preset configurations
- Import/export property mappings

**Phase 3+ Enhancements:**

#### 3.6.5 Material Design Components

**Reusable UI Components:**

The Control Center uses a set of reusable Material Design components adapted from Sonigraph:

**Component Files:**

```
src/ui/
  ├── control-center.ts          ← Main modal class
  ├── material-components.ts     ← Reusable components
  ├── lucide-icons.ts            ← Icon management
  └── control-center.css         ← Material Design styling
```

**Component Library:**

| Component | Purpose | Example Usage |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `MaterialCard` | Content containers with headers | Wrap stat displays, forms |
| `MaterialButton` | Consistent button styling | Actions, navigation |
| `MaterialSlider` | Numeric input with visual feedback | Spacing, dimensions, volume |
| `ActionChip` | Toggle buttons and filters | Enable/disable options |
| `StatCard` | Display key metrics | Vault statistics |
| `EffectSection` | Collapsible settings groups | Group related settings |

**Example Component Usage:**

```typescript
// Create a stat card
const statCard = new StatCard({
  value: '247',
  label: 'Total People',
  iconName: 'users',
  color: 'primary'
});

// Create a material card with content
const settingsCard = new MaterialCard({
  title: 'Layout Configuration',
  iconName: 'layout',
  elevation: 2
});

// Add slider for node width
const widthSlider = new MaterialSlider({
  value: this.plugin.settings.defaultNodeWidth,
  min: 100,
  max: 400,
  step: 10,
  unit: 'px',
  onChange: (value) => {
    this.plugin.settings.defaultNodeWidth = value;
    await this.plugin.saveSettings();
  }
});

settingsCard.addContent(widthSlider.getElement());
```

#### 3.6.6 Styling System

**CSS Architecture:**

Based on Material Design 3 principles, using Obsidian's native color system:

**Design Tokens:**

```css
:root {
  /* Surface colors */
  --crc-surface: var(--background-secondary);
  --crc-surface-variant: var(--background-modifier-border-hover);

  /* Primary colors */
  --crc-primary: var(--interactive-accent);
  --crc-primary-container: var(--interactive-accent-hover);

  /* Text colors */
  --crc-on-surface: var(--text-normal);
  --crc-on-surface-variant: var(--text-muted);

  /* Elevation system */
  --crc-elevation-1: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
  --crc-elevation-2: 0 3px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.16);

  /* Spacing (4dp base unit) */
  --crc-space-2: 8px;
  --crc-space-4: 16px;
  --crc-space-6: 24px;

  /* Corner radius */
  --crc-corner-sm: 8px;
  --crc-corner-md: 12px;

  /* Motion */
  --crc-motion-standard: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1);
  --crc-duration-medium: 300ms;
}
```

**Class Naming Convention:**

- Prefix: `crc-` (Canvas Roots Control)
- BEM methodology: `crc-block__element--modifier`
- Examples:
  - `.crc-modal-container`
  - `.crc-drawer__item--active`
  - `.crc-card__header`

#### 3.6.7 State Management

**Modal State:**

```typescript
interface ControlCenterState {
  activeTab: string;
  lastOpenedPerson?: string;
  quickSettings: {
    rootPerson?: string;
    targetCanvas?: string;
    activeOverlay?: string;
  };
}
```

**State Persistence:**

- Active tab remembered across sessions
- Quick settings cached per session
- Form values preserved during modal lifecycle

#### 3.6.8 Integration Points

**Plugin Integration:**

```typescript
// In main.ts
this.addCommand({
  id: 'open-control-center',
  name: 'Open Control Center',
  callback: () => {
    new ControlCenterModal(this.app, this).open();
  }
});

// Optional ribbon icon
this.addRibbonIcon(
  'git-branch',
  'Canvas Roots Control Center',
  () => {
    new ControlCenterModal(this.app, this).open();
  }
);
```

**Context Menu Integration:**

```typescript
// Right-click on canvas nodes
this.registerEvent(
  this.app.workspace.on('canvas:node-menu', (menu, node) => {
    if (this.isPersonNode(node)) {
      menu.addItem((item) => {
        item
          .setTitle('View in Control Center')
          .setIcon('git-branch')
          .onClick(() => {
            const modal = new ControlCenterModal(this.app, this);
            modal.openToPersonTab(node.file.path);
          });
      });
    }
  })
);
```

---

## 4. Technical Implementation

### 4.1 Dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose | Version |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Obsidian API | Core plugin functionality | Latest |
| D3.js | Layout calculation | 7.x+ |
| TypeScript | Development language | 5.x+ |

### 4.2 Obsidian API Usage

**Required APIs:**
- `app.vault.read()` - Read Canvas JSON and note files
- `app.vault.write()` - Write Canvas JSON
- `app.vault.getAbstractFileByPath()` - Locate person notes
- `Notice` - User feedback/notifications
- `Plugin` - Core plugin class
- `Command` - Register commands

### 4.3 Canvas JSON Structure

The plugin reads and writes Obsidian's Canvas file format (`.canvas`):

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "node-uuid-1",
      "x": 0,
      "y": 0,
      "width": 200,
      "height": 100,
      "type": "file",
      "file": "People/John Smith.md",
      "color": "6"
    },
    {
      "id": "node-uuid-2",
      "x": 50,
      "y": 150,
      "width": 50,
      "height": 30,
      "type": "text",
      "text": "&"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "id": "edge-uuid-3",
      "fromNode": "node-uuid-1",
      "fromSide": "bottom",
      "toNode": "node-uuid-4",
      "toSide": "top"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Node Types:**
- **File nodes:** Person cards (link to `.md` files)
- **Text nodes:** Marriage indicators (optional for MVP)

**Edge Properties:**
- Connect parent to child nodes
- Connect spouse nodes
- Side indicators control connection points

### 4.4 Canvas CSS Variables and Theming

**Overview:** Obsidian Canvas provides CSS variables for customizing canvas appearance. Canvas Roots leverages these for consistent visual styling.

**Available Canvas CSS Variables:**

| Variable | Description | Default Usage |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `--canvas-background` | Canvas background color | Inherited from theme |
| `--canvas-card-label-color` | Canvas card label text color | Inherited from theme |
| `--canvas-dot-pattern` | Canvas dot pattern color | Inherited from theme |
| `--canvas-color-1` | Card/edge color 1 (Red) | Parent-child edges |
| `--canvas-color-2` | Card/edge color 2 (Orange) | Unknown gender nodes |
| `--canvas-color-3` | Card/edge color 3 (Yellow) | Unused (available) |
| `--canvas-color-4` | Card/edge color 4 (Green) | Male nodes |
| `--canvas-color-5` | Card/edge color 5 (Blue) | Spouse edges |
| `--canvas-color-6` | Card/edge color 6 (Purple) | Female nodes |

**Canvas Roots Color Usage (v1.8):**

```typescript
// Node colors (based on sex/gender field)
getPersonColor(person: PersonNode): string {
  if (person.sex === 'M' || person.sex === 'MALE') return '4'; // Green
  if (person.sex === 'F' || person.sex === 'FEMALE') return '6'; // Purple
  return '2'; // Orange (unknown/neutral)
}

// Edge colors (based on relationship type)
getEdgeColor(type: RelationType): string {
  if (type === 'parent' || type === 'child') return '1'; // Red
  if (type === 'spouse') return '5'; // Blue
  return '3'; // Yellow (default)
}
```

**Future Enhancement - Custom Theme Support:**

Canvas Roots could provide custom CSS snippets to override canvas colors specifically for family trees:

```css
/* Custom Canvas Roots theme */
.canvas-node[data-canvas-roots="true"] {
  /* Override canvas colors for family trees */
  --canvas-color-4: #4a9eff; /* Custom male color */
  --canvas-color-6: #ff4a9e; /* Custom female color */
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent with Obsidian's native Canvas styling
- Users can customize colors via CSS snippets
- Theme-aware (respects light/dark mode)
- No custom rendering required

### 4.5 ID Mapping and Persistence

**Challenge:** Maintain stable identity across Canvas re-layouts

**Solution:**
1. **Stable ID:** Use `cr_id` from person note as primary key
2. **Transient ID:** Canvas `node.id` can change between layouts
3. **File Path Matching:** Match Canvas nodes to notes via `file` property
4. **Update Strategy:** Modify existing node positions, don't duplicate

**Coordinate Offset:**
- Calculate relative D3 positions
- Add offset based on current Canvas viewport center
- Ensure tree appears in visible area

---

## 5. GEDCOM Integration

### 5.1 Overview

GEDCOM (Genealogical Data Communication) is the industry standard format for family tree data exchange. Canvas Roots supports import and export.

### 5.2 Import Modes

#### Mode 1: Canvas Visualization (Quick Import)

**Purpose:** Rapid visualization without vault modification

**Process:**
1. Parse `.ged` file
2. Extract relationship data
3. Generate Canvas JSON directly
4. **Do not** create Markdown notes in vault

**Use Case:** Preview external family trees without cluttering vault

#### Mode 2: Vault Deep-Sync (Full Integration)

**Purpose:** Complete genealogical data integration

**Process:**
1. Parse `.ged` file completely
2. Create Markdown note for every:
   - Individual (person)
   - Place
   - Source
3. Populate YAML frontmatter with all GEDCOM fields
4. Establish bidirectional [[Link]] connections
5. Handle multimedia references and extended notes

**Use Case:** Migrate genealogical research into Obsidian vault

### 5.3 Export (Round-Trip)

**Command:** `Canvas Roots: Export to GEDCOM`

**Process:**
1. Find all notes containing `cr_id`
2. Extract person data from frontmatter
3. Generate valid `.ged` file
4. Preserve GEDCOM-specific fields for round-trip compatibility

**Purpose:** Allow users to export edited data back to dedicated genealogy software

### 5.4 Data Compatibility and Analysis

**Property Population:**
- All parsed GEDCOM fields stored in frontmatter/Properties
- Maximum compatibility with Dataview and Obsidian Bases
- Enable complex queries and analysis

**Analysis Queries:**

The plugin should provide utility functions and pre-built DataViewJS templates to enable rich data analysis:

**Example Query Templates:**
- "List all living descendants" - Find all people without `died` dates descended from a specific person
- "Table of individuals by age at death" - Calculate and sort lifespans
- "Source-linked individuals" - Show all people connected to specific historical sources
- "Geographic distribution" - Map individuals by birth/death locations
- "Sibling chain visualization" - Display extended sibling relationships and spouses of siblings

**Implementation:**
- Expose helper functions for common genealogical queries
- Provide template library accessible via command palette
- Support complex multi-table queries via Dataview integration
- Enable export of query results to Canvas or tables

### 5.5 Multi-Vault Merging and UUID-Based Data Portability

**Requirement:** Enable seamless merging of multiple genealogical collections using UUID-based identity management, preventing data conflicts and facilitating collaborative research.

#### 5.5.1 UUID as Universal Identity

**Core Principle:** The `cr_id` field serves as the **single source of truth** for person identity across all vaults, GEDCOM exports, and Canvas representations.

**UUID Properties:**

```yaml
cr_id: "abc-123-def-456"  # UUID v4 format recommended
```

**Requirements:**

| Property | Value | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Format** | UUID v4 (random) | Globally unique, no coordination needed |
| **Immutability** | Never changes once assigned | Stable identity across renames/moves |
| **Auto-generation** | Created on note creation | Prevents manual ID conflicts |
| **GEDCOM mapping** | Maps to `@INDI:xxxxx@` | Round-trip preservation |
| **Persistence** | Preserved across all operations | Export, import, merge, obfuscation |

**Why UUIDs Solve Merging Problems:**

**Without UUIDs:**
- File name collision: Two vaults both have "John Smith.md"
- Cannot determine if same person or different people
- Manual conflict resolution required for every duplicate name
- Risk of data loss or incorrect merges

**With UUIDs:**
- Same `cr_id` = definitively the same person → auto-merge
- Different `cr_id` = definitively different people → keep both
- Name similarity check only for suggesting potential duplicates
- Safe, deterministic merging

#### 5.5.2 Merge Command

**Command:** `Canvas Roots: Merge External Collection`

**Workflow:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Merge External Collection               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Source:  [📁 Browse Vault/Folder...]   │

│ [Cancel]              [Start Merge]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Process:**

1. **Scan source collection** for all notes with `cr_id` fields
2. **Compare with target vault** based on `cr_id` matching
3. **Categorize individuals:**
   - **Exact match:** Same `cr_id` in both vaults
   - **New person:** `cr_id` only exists in source
   - **Potential duplicate:** Different `cr_id` but similar name/dates

#### 5.5.3 Merge Resolution Strategies

**Exact Match (Same `cr_id`):**

When the same `cr_id` exists in both vaults, merge field-by-field:

```yaml
# Target vault (existing)
---
cr_id: abc-123-def-456
name: John Robert Smith
born: 1888-05-15
father: "[[John Smith Sr]]"
spouse: ["[[Mary Jones]]"]
---

# Source vault (being merged)
---
cr_id: abc-123-def-456
name: John R. Smith
died: 1952-08-20
mother: "[[Jane Doe]]"
spouse: ["[[Mary Jones]]", "[[Sarah Brown]]"]
notes: "Veteran of WWI"
---

# Merged result
---
cr_id: abc-123-def-456
name: John Robert Smith  # Keep target (or prompt user)
born: 1888-05-15
died: 1952-08-20         # Add from source
father: "[[John Smith Sr]]"
mother: "[[Jane Doe]]"   # Add from source
spouse: ["[[Mary Jones]]", "[[Sarah Brown]]"]  # Merge arrays
notes: "Veteran of WWI"  # Add from source
---
```

**Merge Rules:**

| Field Conflict | Default Behavior | User Override |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Both have value** | Prompt user to choose | Always target/source/merge |
| **One has value** | Use the available value | N/A |
| **Arrays** | Union of both arrays | Keep target only |
| **Dates** | Keep most precise format | Choose manually |
| **Note body** | Append source to target with separator | Overwrite/skip |

**New Person (Source only):**

Simply import the note with all data intact:

```yaml
---
cr_id: xyz-789-new-123
name: Maria Romano
born: 1905-03-12
# ... rest of data
---
```

**Potential Duplicate Detection:**

When different `cr_id` values have suspiciously similar data:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⚠️ Potential Duplicate Detected         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Target Vault:                           │
│ cr_id: aaa-111-bbb-222                  │
│ Name: John Smith                        │
│ Born: 1888-05-15                        │
│ Died: 1952-08-20                        │
│                                         │
│ Source Vault:                           │
│ cr_id: ccc-333-ddd-444                  │
│ Name: John Smith                        │
│ Born: 1888-05-14  (1 day difference!)  │
│ Died: 1952-08                           │
│                                         │
│ Are these the same person?              │
│ [Yes - Merge] [No - Keep Both] [Skip]  │
│                                         │
│ If merged, which cr_id should be kept?  │
│ ○ aaa-111-bbb-222 (target)              │
│ ○ ccc-333-ddd-444 (source)              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Similarity Detection Criteria:**

- **Name:** Exact match or close Levenshtein distance
- **Dates:** Birth/death within reasonable threshold (e.g., 5 years)
- **Parents:** Same parent names (even if different `cr_id`)
- **Location:** Same birth/death places

#### 5.5.4 GEDCOM UUID Preservation

**Export Mapping:**

```gedcom
0 @I001@ INDI
1 _UUID abc-123-def-456
1 NAME John Robert /Smith/
1 BIRT
2 DATE 15 MAY 1888
```

**Round-Trip Guarantee:**

1. **Obsidian → GEDCOM:** `cr_id` stored in `_UUID` tag
2. **GEDCOM → Obsidian:** `_UUID` tag restored to `cr_id` field
3. **Merge after round-trip:** Same person recognized by preserved UUID

**Benefits:**

- Export to Family Tree Maker, keep `cr_id` in custom tag
- Re-import after external edits, preserve identity
- Merge external GEDCOM files that originated from Canvas Roots

#### 5.5.5 Collaborative Research Workflow

**Use Case:** Multiple researchers working on same family tree

**Scenario:**
- Researcher A has paternal line (500 people)
- Researcher B has maternal line (400 people)
- 50 people appear in both collections (shared ancestors)

**Workflow:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Each researcher maintains separate vault
   - Each assigns unique `cr_id` to all individuals

2. **Export/Share:**
   - Researcher A exports to GEDCOM with UUID preservation
   - Sends to Researcher B

3. **Merge:**
   - Researcher B runs `Merge External Collection`
   - Plugin detects 50 shared ancestors via duplicate detection
   - User confirms which individuals are same person
   - Plugin merges data, updates `cr_id` references

4. **Synchronization:**
   - Future merges recognize same `cr_id` values
   - Only new/changed data prompts for review

#### 5.5.6 Merge Conflict Log

After merge completes, generate a detailed log:

```markdown
# Merge Log - 2025-11-18 15:30:00

**Source:** /path/to/external/vault
**Target:** Current vault

## Summary

- **New individuals added:** 320
- **Exact matches merged:** 45
- **Potential duplicates reviewed:** 12
  - Merged as same person: 8
  - Kept as separate: 4
- **Conflicts resolved:** 23

  post_merge:
    generate_log: true
    backup_before_merge: true
    validate_relationships: true   # Check for broken links
```

#### 5.5.8 Use Cases

**Multi-Vault Research:**
- Maintain separate vaults for different family branches
- Periodically merge to create master tree
- Export combined tree for publication

**Collaborative Genealogy:**
- Multiple family members research independently
- Share GEDCOM exports with UUID preservation
- Merge contributions without data loss

**External Data Integration:**
- Import GEDCOM from Ancestry.com (assign UUIDs on import)
- Add research in Obsidian
- Re-import updated Ancestry data later
- Merge recognizes same individuals via UUID

**Disaster Recovery:**
- Vault corruption or accidental deletion
- Restore from GEDCOM backup
- Merge with current vault to recover lost data
- UUIDs prevent duplicate creation

**Migration from Other Tools:**
- Export from Family Tree Maker
- Import to Canvas Roots (assign UUIDs)
- Continue research in Obsidian
- Later merge with data from GenoPro (also UUID-tagged)

---

### 5.6 Privacy and Data Obfuscation

**Requirement:** Protect personally identifiable information (PII) when sharing family trees publicly or for demonstrations.

#### 5.6.1 Obfuscation Modes

The plugin must support optional obfuscation during export and canvas rendering:

**Export Obfuscation:**
- Applied during GEDCOM export via export dialog option
- Original vault data remains completely intact
- Generate obfuscated `.ged` file for sharing

**Canvas Obfuscation:**
- Temporary display mode for screenshots/presentations
- Toggle via command: `Canvas Roots: Toggle Obfuscation Mode`
- Visual indicator when obfuscation is active
- Does not modify underlying notes

#### 5.6.2 Obfuscation Levels

| Level | Names | Dates | Locations | Notes/Research | Media |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **None** | Original | Original | Original | Original | Original |
| **Minimal** | Original | Year only | Original | Original | Original |
| **Standard** | Anonymized | Year only | Region only | Stripped | Excluded |
| **Full** | Anonymized | Fuzzy ranges | Generic | Stripped | Excluded |

#### 5.6.3 Selective Obfuscation Filters

**Requirement:** Apply obfuscation selectively based on individual characteristics for targeted privacy protection.

**Living Individuals Filter:**
- **Auto-detection:** Calculate if person is likely living based on birth date and death date
  - No `died` date AND (`born` within last 110 years OR no `born` date) = Presumed living
  - Configurable threshold (default: 110 years)
- **Manual override:** `cr_living: true/false` property to explicitly mark status
- **Privacy protection:** When "Living individuals only" option is enabled, obfuscate only people marked as living
- **GEDCOM standard:** Aligns with GEDCOM's "LIVING" tag convention

**Children Filter:**
- **Age-based:** Obfuscate individuals under specified age (e.g., under 18)
- **Relationship-based:** Option to obfuscate all individuals in the youngest generation
- **Custom threshold:** Configurable age threshold for minor protection
- **Combined with living filter:** Can apply both filters simultaneously

**Filter Combinations:**

| Filter Setting | Who Gets Obfuscated |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **All individuals** | Everyone in the tree |
| **Living only** | Anyone without death date or born within threshold |
| **Children only** | Anyone under age threshold |
| **Living + Children** | Union of both groups (more protective) |
| **Deceased only** | Inverse - obfuscate historical records, show living (rare use case) |

**Example Configuration:**

```yaml
# In plugin settings or export dialog
obfuscation:
  level: standard
  filters:
    living_only: true
    living_threshold_years: 110
    include_minors: true
    minor_age_threshold: 18
```

**Use Cases:**

**Legal Compliance:**
- GDPR requires explicit consent for living individuals' data
- Many jurisdictions have special protections for minors
- Some genealogical societies restrict sharing living persons' data

**Ethical Genealogy:**
- Protect privacy of living relatives who didn't consent
- Shield children from public exposure
- Share historical research without exposing current family

**Flexible Sharing:**
- Share complete historical tree (deceased only)
- Share structure with living relatives obfuscated for public demos
- Create educational materials protecting recent generations

**Obfuscation Strategies:**

**Names:**
- **Pattern-based:** "Person A", "Person B", "Person C" (maintains readability)
- **Generated:** Use common placeholder names maintaining gender/cultural context
- **Relationship-based:** "Father of Person A", "Mother of Person B"

**Dates:**
- **Year only:** `1847-03-15` → `1847`
- **Decade:** `1847-03-15` → `1840s`
- **Fuzzy ranges:** `1847-03-15` → `circa 1845-1850`
- **Relative:** Maintain age differences and generation gaps

**Locations:**
- **Region only:** "Boston, Massachusetts, USA" → "Massachusetts, USA"
- **Country only:** "Boston, Massachusetts, USA" → "USA"
- **Generic:** "Boston, Massachusetts, USA" → "Urban area, Northeast USA"

**Research Notes:**
- **Strip all:** Remove all note content
- **Summarize:** "Has 3 sources, 2 media attachments"
- **Template:** Replace with placeholder text

**Media:**
- **Exclude links:** Remove all photo/document references
- **Placeholder:** Replace with generic avatar/document icon

#### 5.6.4 Obfuscation Mapping

**Mapping File Generation:**

When obfuscation is applied, optionally generate a JSON mapping file for reversing:

```json
{
  "obfuscation_date": "2025-11-18T15:30:00Z",
  "obfuscation_level": "standard",
  "mappings": {
    "Person A": "John Robert Smith",
    "Person B": "Mary Elizabeth Jones",
    "1847": "1847-03-15",
    "Massachusetts, USA": "Boston, Massachusetts, USA"
  }
}
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Mapping file stored locally only (never included in export)
- User prompted to store in secure location
- Optional encryption of mapping file
- Clear warning that mapping file is sensitive

#### 5.6.5 Structural Integrity

**What Must Be Preserved:**
- Relationship structure (parent-child, spouse connections)
- Relative chronology (birth order, generation gaps)
- `cr_id` values (needed for graph structure)
- Number of children, spouses, generations

**Validation:**
- Obfuscated export must remain valid GEDCOM
- Relationship logic must be testable/verifiable
- Canvas rendering must remain functional

#### 5.6.6 User Interface

**Export Dialog:**
```

## 6. Enhanced Relationship Modeling

### 6.1 Multiple Spouse Support

**Requirement:** Support complex marital histories with temporal tracking

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (v0.1.1+)

#### 6.1.1 Data Structure

**Enhanced Format with Metadata (Flat, Indexed Properties):**

Uses numbered properties that are fully compatible with Obsidian's Properties panel and Obsidian Bases:

```yaml
# First spouse
spouse1: "[[Jane Doe]]"
spouse1_id: "jane-cr-id-123"
spouse1_marriage_date: "1985-06-15"
spouse1_divorce_date: "1992-03-20"
spouse1_marriage_status: divorced
spouse1_marriage_location: "Boston, MA"

# Second spouse
spouse2: "[[Mary Johnson]]"
spouse2_id: "mary-cr-id-456"
spouse2_marriage_date: "1995-08-10"
spouse2_marriage_status: current
spouse2_marriage_location: "Seattle, WA"

# Third spouse (if applicable)
spouse3: "[[Sarah Williams]]"
spouse3_id: "sarah-cr-id-789"
spouse3_marriage_date: "2005-03-22"
spouse3_marriage_status: widowed
```

**Legacy Format (Backward Compatible):**

```yaml
# Simple wikilink format (still supported)
spouse: "[[Jane Doe]]"
spouse_id: "jane-cr-id-123"

# Or array format
spouse: ["[[Jane Doe]]", "[[Mary Johnson]]"]
spouse_id: ["jane-cr-id-123", "mary-cr-id-456"]
```

**Why Flat Indexed Format:**

- ✅ **Obsidian Properties Panel:** Users can edit all fields directly in Obsidian's UI
- ✅ **Obsidian Bases Compatible:** Works seamlessly with table-based editing
- ✅ **Future-proof:** Uses only officially supported YAML structures
- ✅ **Human-readable:** Clear numbering shows marriage order at a glance

**Field Descriptions:**

| Field Pattern | Type | Required | Description |
|---------------|------|----------|-------------|
| `spouseN` | Wikilink | Yes | Link to Nth spouse's person note (N = 1, 2, 3...) |
| `spouseN_id` | String (UUID) | Yes | Spouse's `cr_id` for stable identification |
| `spouseN_marriage_date` | Date | No | Date of marriage (flexible format per §6.4) |
| `spouseN_divorce_date` | Date | No | Date of divorce/separation if applicable |
| `spouseN_marriage_status` | Enum | No | Current status: `divorced`, `widowed`, `current`, `separated`, `annulled` |
| `spouseN_marriage_location` | String | No | Place of marriage (can be wikilink to location note) |

#### 6.1.2 Backward Compatibility

**Detection Logic:**

The system detects which format is used by scanning frontmatter properties:

1. **If `spouse1` field exists:** Use enhanced flat indexed format with metadata
2. **If `spouse` or `spouse_id` exists:** Use legacy format (simple array)
3. **Parsing priority:** Enhanced format takes precedence if both exist

**Migration Path:**

Users can migrate from legacy to enhanced format at their own pace:

```yaml
# Before migration (legacy array format)
spouse: ["[[Jane Doe]]", "[[Mary Johnson]]"]
spouse_id: ["jane-cr-id-123", "mary-cr-id-456"]

# After migration (enhanced flat format - add metadata gradually)
spouse1: "[[Jane Doe]]"
spouse1_id: "jane-cr-id-123"
spouse1_marriage_status: divorced

spouse2: "[[Mary Johnson]]"
spouse2_id: "mary-cr-id-456"
spouse2_marriage_status: current
spouse2_marriage_date: "1995-08-10"
```

**No Breaking Changes:** All existing trees continue to work without modification.

#### 6.1.3 Canvas Visualization

**Multiple Spouse Positioning:**

- ✅ Spouses positioned in chronological order (marriage_order or marriage_date)
- ✅ Visual spacing between spouse groups for clarity
- ✅ All children connected to appropriate parental units
- ✅ Layout engine uses family-chart library for proper spouse handling

**Spouse Edge Display (Optional):**

By default, spouse relationships are indicated by visual positioning only (clean, minimal look). Users can optionally enable spouse edges with marriage metadata in Canvas Settings:

- ✅ **Toggle:** Show/hide spouse edges (default: hidden)
- ✅ **Label formats:**
  - None: No labels
  - Date only: "m. 1985"
  - Date and location: "m. 1985 | Boston, MA"
  - Full details: "m. 1985 | Boston, MA | div. 1992"
- ✅ **Settings location:** Control Center → Canvas Settings → Spouse edge display

**Visual Indicators (Future Enhancement):**

- Edge styling based on marriage_status:
  - Solid line: current marriage
  - Dashed line: divorced
  - Dotted line: widowed
- Color coding or icons for marriage status

**Child Association:**

When applicable, connect children to specific spousal relationships:

```yaml
# In child's note
father: "[[John Smith]]"
mother: "[[Jane Doe]]"
father_marriage_order: 1  # Child from first marriage
```

This helps clarify which children belong to which marriage.

#### 6.1.4 Implementation Status

**Phase 1: Data Model Updates** ✅ Complete

1. ✅ Added `SpouseRelationship` interface to `src/models/person.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export interface SpouseRelationship {
     personId: string;              // cr_id of spouse
     personLink?: string;           // Wikilink for display
     marriageDate?: string;         // ISO date or flexible format
     divorceDate?: string;
     marriageStatus?: 'current' | 'divorced' | 'widowed' | 'separated' | 'annulled';
     marriageLocation?: string;
     marriageOrder?: number;
   }
   ```

2. ✅ Updated `PersonNode` interface:
   ```typescript
   export interface PersonNode {
     // ... existing fields
     spouseIds: string[];                    // Legacy: simple array of cr_ids
     spouses?: SpouseRelationship[];         // Enhanced: array with metadata
   }
   ```

**Phase 2: Reading/Parsing** ✅ Complete

1. ✅ Updated `extractPersonNode()` in `src/core/family-graph.ts`:
   - Detect presence of `spouse1` field (enhanced flat indexed format)
   - Scan for all indexed spouse properties (`spouse1`, `spouse2`, `spouse3`, etc.)
   - Parse spouse metadata for each index
   - Fall back to `spouse`/`spouse_id` for legacy format
   - Populate both `spouseIds` (for compatibility) and `spouses` (for new features)

2. Handle both formats seamlessly:
   ```typescript
   // If enhanced flat indexed format exists
   if (fm.spouse1 || fm.spouse1_id) {
     node.spouses = parseIndexedSpouseRelationships(fm);
     node.spouseIds = node.spouses.map(s => s.personId);
   }
   // Otherwise fall back to legacy
   else if (fm.spouse_id || fm.spouse) {
     node.spouseIds = parseLegacySpouses(fm);
   }
   ```

3. Indexed property scanning logic:
   ```typescript
   function parseIndexedSpouseRelationships(fm: any): SpouseRelationship[] {
     const spouses: SpouseRelationship[] = [];
     let index = 1;

     // Scan for spouse1, spouse2, spouse3, etc.
     while (fm[`spouse${index}`] || fm[`spouse${index}_id`]) {
       const personId = fm[`spouse${index}_id`] || extractCrIdFromWikilink(fm[`spouse${index}`]);
       if (personId) {
         spouses.push({
           personId,
           personLink: fm[`spouse${index}`],
           marriageDate: fm[`spouse${index}_marriage_date`],
           divorceDate: fm[`spouse${index}_divorce_date`],
           marriageStatus: fm[`spouse${index}_marriage_status`],
           marriageLocation: fm[`spouse${index}_marriage_location`],
           marriageOrder: index  // Use index as implicit order
         });
       }
       index++;
     }

     return spouses;
   }
   ```

**Phase 3: Graph Building** ✅ Complete

1. ✅ Family graph traversal uses spouse metadata
2. ✅ Marriage order preserved when building tree structure
3. ✅ Spouse relationships passed to layout engine

**Phase 4: Layout Engine** ✅ Complete

1. ✅ Updated `src/core/family-chart-layout.ts`:
   - ✅ Passes spouse metadata to family-chart library
   - ✅ Uses `marriageOrder` to determine positioning sequence
   - ✅ Handles multiple spouse nodes per person

2. ✅ Layout considerations:
   - ✅ Positions spouses in order (earliest marriage first)
   - ✅ Maintains visual clarity with appropriate spacing
   - ✅ Connects children to correct parental pairs

**Phase 5: Canvas Generation** ✅ Complete

1. ✅ Updated `src/core/canvas-generator.ts`:
   - ✅ Generates nodes for all spouses
   - ✅ Creates spouse edges with optional labels
   - ✅ Positions according to layout results
   - ✅ Formats marriage metadata for edge labels

2. ✅ Canvas Settings UI (Control Center):
   - ✅ Toggle for showing/hiding spouse edges
   - ✅ Dropdown for label format selection
   - ✅ Settings persist across sessions

**Phase 6: GEDCOM Integration** ✅ Complete (Import), 🔴 Planned (Export)

1. ✅ GEDCOM importer extracts marriage metadata:
   - ✅ FAM records processed for marriage information
   - ✅ MARR tag extraction for marriage events
   - ✅ DIV tag extraction for divorce dates
   - ✅ PLAC tag extraction for locations
   - ✅ Creates flat indexed spouse properties (`spouse1_marriage_date`, etc.)

2. Export spouse metadata to GEDCOM:
   - Generate proper FAM records
   - Include MARR/DIV events
   - Maintain GEDCOM compatibility

#### 6.1.5 Testing Strategy

**Test Cases:**

1. **Legacy format only:** Ensure backward compatibility
2. **Enhanced format only:** Verify metadata parsing
3. **Mixed formats in vault:** Both formats coexist
4. **Multiple spouses:** Person with 3+ marriages
5. **Divorced + remarried:** Complex marital history
6. **Missing metadata:** Graceful degradation (marriage_date optional)
7. **Layout correctness:** Spouse positioning follows chronological order

**Test Data Files:**

Create test person notes in `test-vault/`:
- `john-smith-simple.md` - Legacy format with 2 spouses
- `john-smith-enhanced.md` - Enhanced format with full metadata
- `jane-doe-complex.md` - 3 marriages with mixed statuses

### 6.2 Multiple and Alternative Parent Relationships

**Requirement:** Track biological, adoptive, step, foster, and guardian relationships

step_mother: "[[Lisa Brown]]"
foster_parents:
  - "[[David Wilson]]"
  - "[[Carol Wilson]]"
guardians:
  - "[[Thomas Anderson]]"
```

**Legacy Mapping:** `father` and `mother` default to biological parents

**Visual Differentiation:**
- Different edge styles for relationship types:
  - Solid lines: biological
  - Dashed lines: adoptive
  - Dotted lines: step-parents
  - Custom colors per relationship type
- Edge labels for clarity

**Settings:** Control which parent types display by default

### 6.3 Unknown or Missing Parent Handling

**Requirement:** Represent incomplete genealogical data clearly

**Data Markers:**

|--------|---------|-----------|
| `YYYY` | `1847` | Year only |
| `YYYY-MM` | `1847-03` | Year and month |
| `YYYY-MM-DD` | `1847-03-15` | Full date |
| `~YYYY` | `~1847` | Approximate year |
| `circa YYYY` | `circa 1847` | Approximate year |
| `YYYY/YYYY` | `1847/1848` | Date range |

**Display Formatting:**
- Render based on available precision
- Examples: "1847", "March 1847", "15 March 1847"

**Date Calculations:**

### 6.5.1 Person Note Context Menu

Right-click actions for person notes (files with `cr_id` frontmatter):

**"Add relationship..." (Submenu):**
- **"Add parent"** - Opens PersonPicker, adds selected person to `father`/`mother` field
- **"Add spouse"** - Opens PersonPicker, adds selected person to next available `spouseN` field
- **"Add child"** - Opens PersonPicker, adds selected person to `children` array
- All actions update both wikilink and `_id` fields (dual storage)
- Shows success Notice with relationship details

**"Validate relationships":**
- Checks all `_id` references (father_id, mother_id, spouse_id, children_id)
- Verifies each `cr_id` exists in vault
- Identifies orphaned wikilinks (link exists but no matching `cr_id`)
- Displays results in modal with "Jump to note" buttons for each issue
- Shows success Notice if no issues found

**"Find on canvas":**
- Searches all `.canvas` files for nodes containing this person's file path
- If found: opens canvas and centers viewport on the node
- If multiple canvases: shows selection modal
- If not found: shows Notice "Person not found on any canvas"

### 6.5.2 Folder Context Menu

Right-click actions for folders:

**"Set as people folder":**
- Updates `settings.peopleFolder` to clicked folder's path
- Saves settings
- Shows Notice: "People folder set to: [folder path]"
- Simple one-click alternative to manual settings configuration

**"Import GEDCOM to this folder":**

## 8. Multi-Family Tree UX Enhancements

### 8.1 Overview

When a vault contains multiple disconnected family trees (common in multi-family GEDCOMs or research vaults), users need better tools to understand, navigate, and generate trees for all family groups.

**Current Implementation (v0.1.0):**
- Full Family Tree only shows people connected to selected root
- Persistent notice informs user about disconnected families
- Users must manually generate separate trees for each family group

**Proposed Enhancements:** Improve discoverability and workflow for multi-family scenarios

---

### 8.2 Component Detection

**Status:** ✅ Implemented (foundation)

The `FamilyGraphService.findAllFamilyComponents()` method detects disconnected family groups using breadth-first traversal.

**Returns:**
```typescript
Array<{
  representative: PersonNode;  // Oldest person or first alphabetically
  size: number;                // Number of people in component
  people: PersonNode[];        // All people in component
}>
```

**Use Cases:**
- Power "Generate All Trees" command
- Display family group indicators in person picker
- Show component summary before tree generation

---

### 8.3 Generate All Trees Command

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** Moderate
**Actual Effort:** ~45 minutes

**Description:**
Add a command that automatically generates separate canvas files for all disconnected family groups in one operation.

**User Interface:**
```
Command Palette: "Canvas Roots: Generate all family trees"

Workflow:
1. Detect all family components
2. For each component:
   - Generate Full Family Tree from representative person
   - Save as "Family Tree - {RepresentativeName}.canvas"
3. Show summary notice: "Generated 6 family trees (48, 32, 28, 19, 18, 18 people)"
```

**Benefits:**
- One-command workflow for multi-family GEDCOMs
- Immediate visibility into all family groups
- Saves manual effort of generating each tree

**Implementation Notes:**
- ✅ Reuses existing tree generation logic
- ✅ Uses component representative (oldest person by birth date) as root for each tree
- ✅ Applies naming convention: `Family Tree {N} - {Name}.canvas` (numbered for clarity)
- ✅ Command added to main.ts with ID `generate-all-trees`
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully, continues with remaining trees if one fails
- ✅ Shows progress notices and final summary

**Implementation Details:**
- Location: [main.ts:149-160](../../main.ts#L149-L160) (command registration)
- Location: [control-center.ts:268-364](../ui/control-center.ts#L268-L364) (implementation)
- Validates vault has multiple components before proceeding
- Generates full family tree (unlimited generations, includes spouses)
- Creates/overwrites canvas files with numbered names

---

### 8.4 Family Group Indicator in Person Picker

**Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Moderate-High
**Actual Effort:** ~45 minutes

**Description:**
Visually group people by family component in the person picker modal, helping users understand which people are connected.

**User Interface:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Select root person                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 🔍 Search...                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Family Group 1 (45 people)          │
│   • William Anderson (1905-1982)    │
│   • Margaret O'Brien (1908-1995)    │
│   • Robert Anderson (1930-2010)     │
│   ...                               │
│                                     │
│ Family Group 2 (15 people)          │
│   • Carlos Johnson (1920-2001)      │
│   • Maria Martinez (1925-2008)      │
│   ...                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear visual separation of disconnected families
- Helps users select representative from correct family
- Shows family sizes at a glance

**Implementation Notes:**
- ✅ Calls `findAllFamilyComponents()` when loading people
- ✅ Builds component map (cr_id → component index) for fast lookups
- ✅ Groups filtered people by component before rendering
- ✅ Renders section headers with family group number and size
- ✅ Gracefully degrades to flat list when only one component exists
- ✅ Maintains all existing filtering and sorting functionality

**Implementation Details:**
- Location: [person-picker.ts:98-119](../ui/person-picker.ts#L98-L119) (component detection)
- Location: [person-picker.ts:391-430](../ui/person-picker.ts#L391-L430) (grouped rendering)
- CSS: [modals.css:609-637](../../styles/modals.css#L609-L637) (group header styles)

---

### 8.5 Post-Generation Action Button

**Priority:** High
**Complexity:** Low
**Estimated Effort:** 15-20 minutes

**Description:**
Add an actionable button to the disconnected family notice that opens a picker for generating trees from remaining family groups.

**User Interface:**
```
Current notice:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Full Family Tree shows 45 of 60 people. │
│                                          │
│ 15 people are not connected to William   │
│ Anderson through family relationships.   │
│                                          │
│ This usually means your vault has        │
│ multiple separate family trees...        │
│                                          │
│ [Generate Other Trees] [Dismiss]        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

Clicking "Generate Other Trees":
- Opens modal listing remaining components
- User selects which to generate
- Generates selected trees
```

**Benefits:**
- Actionable next step from notice
- Reduces friction for multi-family workflows
- Complements existing notice

**Implementation Notes:**
- Modify Notice to include button (may need custom Notice)
- Button triggers component picker modal
- Generate trees for selected components

---

### 8.6 Pre-Generation Component Summary

**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 60-90 minutes

**Description:**

**User Interface:**
```
When user selects "Generate Tree" from Control Center:

┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Family Trees in Vault                      │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ This vault contains 2 disconnected family  │
│ trees. Select which to generate:           │
│                                            │
│ ☑ Anderson family (45 people)             │
│   Root: William Anderson (1905-1982)      │
│                                            │
│ ☐ Martinez/Johnson family (15 people)     │
│   Root: Carlos Johnson (1920-2001)        │
│                                            │
│ [Generate Selected] [Generate All] [Back] │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Proactive information before generation
- User choice over which trees to create
- Prevents surprise at partial results

**Implementation Notes:**
- Check components before tree generation
- If multiple components exist, show picker
- Allow multi-select or "Generate All" option
- Skip picker if only one component

---

### 8.7 Settings Configuration

**Priority:** Low
**Complexity:** Low
**Estimated Effort:** 20-30 minutes

**Description:**
Add setting for default behavior when encountering multi-family vaults.

**User Interface:**
```
Settings > Canvas Roots > Multi-Family Handling

When vault contains multiple family trees:
( ) Show notice only (current)
( ) Ask which families to generate
( ) Auto-generate all families

☐ Always show component summary before generation
```

**Benefits:**
- User control over default behavior
- Power users can auto-generate all trees
- Casual users can keep notice-only approach

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add to CanvasRootsSettings interface
- Check setting in tree generation workflow
- Apply appropriate behavior based on setting

---

### 8.8 Implementation Priority

**Completed:**
- ✅ **§8.2 Component Detection** - Foundation for all multi-family features
- ✅ **§8.3 Generate All Trees Command** - One-command workflow for multi-family GEDCOMs
- ✅ **§8.4 Family Group Indicator** - Visual grouping in person picker modal

**Remaining (Recommended Order):**
1. **§8.5 Post-Generation Action Button** (adapted - command reference in notice) - ✅ Already addressed
2. **§8.7 Settings Configuration** (quick, medium value) - 20-30 min
3. **§8.6 Pre-Generation Summary** (complex, high value long-term) - 60-90 min

**Rationale:**
Start with §8.5 (action button) as the quickest high-impact improvement. This complements the existing notice and provides immediate next steps for users. Add visual polish with §8.4 (family group indicators) to help users understand component structure. Settings (§8.7) give power users control. Save complex modal flows (§8.6) for when user feedback validates the approach.
