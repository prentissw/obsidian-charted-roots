2. It will automatically detect changes to `main.js` in your vault's plugin directory
3. After running `npm run build`, copy the files to your vault
4. Hot Reload will automatically reload the plugin

## Context Menu Implementation

### File Menu Integration

To add a context menu item that appears when right-clicking on person notes:

**Implementation in main.ts:**

```typescript
this.registerEvent(
  this.app.workspace.on('file-menu', (menu, file) => {
    // Only show for person notes (files with cr_id in frontmatter)
    if (file instanceof TFile && file.extension === 'md') {
      // Check if file has cr_id property
      const cache = this.app.metadataCache.getFileCache(file);
      if (cache?.frontmatter?.cr_id) {
        menu.addItem((item) => {
          item
            .setTitle('Generate Family Tree')
            .setIcon('git-fork')
            .onClick(async () => {
              // Open Control Center with this person pre-selected
              const modal = new ControlCenterModal(this.app, this);
              modal.openWithPerson(file);
            });
        });
      }
    }
  })
);
```

**Required ControlCenterModal changes:**

Add `openWithPerson()` method to pre-select person and navigate to Tree Generation tab:

```typescript
public openWithPerson(file: TFile): void {
  this.open();

  // Switch to Tree Generation tab
  this.switchToTab('tree-generation');

  // Pre-populate the root person field
  const cache = this.app.metadataCache.getFileCache(file);
  if (cache?.frontmatter) {
    const crId = cache.frontmatter.cr_id;
    const name = cache.frontmatter.name || file.basename;

    // Set the person picker value
    this.setRootPerson({ crId, name, file });
  }
}
```

## Canvas Generation Implementation

### Canvas Node ID Format

Canvas nodes require alphanumeric IDs without special characters (dashes, underscores, etc.). The plugin generates these using `Math.random().toString(36)`:

```typescript
// Good: alphanumeric only
"6qi8mqi3quaufgk0imt33f"

// Bad: contains dashes (not movable in Obsidian)
"qjk-453-lms-042"
```

**Implementation:** The canvas generator maintains a mapping from `cr_id` (person identifier) to `canvasId` (canvas node identifier) to ensure edges connect correctly while using Obsidian-compatible IDs.

### Canvas JSON Format

Obsidian Canvas requires a specific JSON format:

1. **Tab indentation** (`\t`) for structure
2. **Compact objects** - each node/edge on a single line with no spaces after colons/commas
3. **Required metadata** - version and frontmatter fields

Example:
```json
{
	"nodes":[
		{"id":"abc123","type":"file","file":"Person.md","x":0,"y":0,"width":250,"height":120}
	],
	"edges":[],
	"metadata":{
		"version":"1.0-1.0",
		"frontmatter":{}
	}
}
```

**Implementation:** Custom `formatCanvasJson()` method in `control-center.ts` ensures exact format match.

### Known Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Canvas nodes not movable/resizable
**Cause:** Canvas node IDs contained dashes (e.g., `qjk-453-lms-042`)
**Solution:** Generate alphanumeric-only IDs matching Obsidian's format
**Fixed in:** canvas-generator.ts lines 132-141

#### Issue: Canvas cleared on close/reopen
**Cause:** JSON formatting didn't match Obsidian's exact requirements
**Solution:** Implement custom JSON formatter with tabs and compact objects
**Fixed in:** control-center.ts lines 1067-1100

#### Issue: Race condition when opening canvas
**Cause:** Canvas opened before file system write completed
**Solution:** Add 100ms delay before opening canvas file
**Fixed in:** control-center.ts lines 1052-1055

#### Issue: GEDCOM import only shows root person in tree
**Cause:** GEDCOM importer's second pass replaced IDs in wrong fields (father/mother/spouse instead of father_id/mother_id/spouse_id)
**Solution:** Update regex patterns to target correct _id fields with dual storage
**Fixed in:** gedcom-importer.ts lines 208-246 (2025-11-20)

## Design Decisions

### Switch to family-chart Library (2025-11-20)

**Decision:** Replaced the custom D3.js hierarchy layout engine with the family-chart library for calculating family tree positions.

**Rationale:**
- Complex spouse relationships: D3's hierarchy layout doesn't natively support multiple spouses or marriage connections, which are fundamental to genealogy
- Overlapping nodes: The original implementation couldn't handle extended families where siblings-in-law and multiple generations created visual conflicts
- Specialized algorithm: family-chart is purpose-built for genealogical visualization with algorithms designed for family relationships
- Spouse positioning: family-chart automatically places spouses side-by-side at the same generation level
- Maintained separation: Layout calculation remains separate from canvas generation, preserving the clean architecture

**Implementation:**
- Created [src/core/family-chart-layout.ts](../src/core/family-chart-layout.ts) as new layout engine
- Integrated family-chart's `f3.calculateTree()` for position calculation
- Added custom logic to handle "siblings-in-law" (people connected only through marriage) that family-chart excludes
- Implemented smart ancestor selection algorithm to choose optimal tree root for best visual layout
- Updated default spacing settings (400px horizontal, 250px vertical) with 1.5x multiplier for family-chart's algorithm
- Maintained LayoutEngine interface compatibility for future flexibility

**Challenges Solved:**
- Overlapping nodes at generation boundaries (e.g., grandparents hiding behind parents)
- Missing people in output when they're not in direct bloodline (siblings-in-law)
- Inconsistent tree orientation (wrong person at top/y=0)
- Spacing optimization for Canvas name labels

**Technical Details:**
- Uses family-chart's `ancestry_depth: undefined` and `progeny_depth: undefined` to show full family
- Implements manual positioning strategy for missing people (place next to spouse or above children)
- Applies 1.5x spacing multiplier to account for Canvas labels and visual clarity
- Maintains post-processing step to enforce minimum spacing and prevent overlaps

**Impact:**
- Zero overlapping nodes in complex family trees
- Proper handling of multiple spouses, adoptive parents, and extended family
- More accurate genealogical representation
- Better visual clarity with appropriate spacing
- Original layout-engine.ts retained for potential future use or comparison

### Layout Engine Extraction (2025-11-20)

**Decision:** Extracted D3.js layout calculation logic from canvas-generator.ts into a dedicated LayoutEngine class.

**Rationale:**
- Separation of concerns: layout calculation vs. canvas JSON generation are distinct responsibilities
- Reusability: LayoutEngine can be used independently for the re-layout command
- Testability: Layout logic can be tested without canvas generation dependencies
- Clarity: Each module has a single, well-defined purpose

**Implementation:**
- Created [src/core/layout-engine.ts](../src/core/layout-engine.ts) with LayoutEngine class
- Defined LayoutOptions interface for configuration (spacing, direction, tree type)
- Created CanvasGenerationOptions extending LayoutOptions with canvas-specific options (colorByGender, showLabels)
- Refactored CanvasGenerator to use LayoutEngine as a service
- Removed 98 lines of embedded layout logic from canvas-generator.ts

**Impact:**
- Cleaner architecture with better module boundaries
- Layout engine ready for re-layout command implementation
- Easier to maintain and extend layout algorithms
- Canvas generator now focuses purely on JSON format conversion

### Canvas-Only Mode Removal (2025-11-20)

**Decision:** Removed the canvas-only import mode entirely. GEDCOM imports now always create person notes in the vault.

**Rationale:**
- Canvas-only mode provided limited value - users couldn't leverage Obsidian features (backlinks, graph view, manual editing)
- Data was locked in Canvas JSON format, not user-friendly for editing or external tools
- Two code paths created maintenance burden and complexity
- Users who started with canvas-only would need migration tooling later
- Person notes enable richer workflows: adding photos, stories, documents, linking to daily notes

**Impact:**
- Simplified codebase (removed 67 lines)
- Clearer value proposition: plugin manages family relationships using person notes
- Better user experience with full Obsidian integration from the start
- Removed confusing setting from UI

## Recent Features

### Re-Layout Canvas Command (2025-11-21)

**Added:** Complete re-layout functionality for existing family tree canvases.

**Implemented Features:**

1. **Command Integration:**
   - Command Palette: "Re-layout current canvas"
   - Right-click menu on canvas files (file explorer, tab bar, three-dot menu)

2. **Smart Re-Layout Logic:**
   - Reads existing canvas JSON structure
   - Extracts person notes and relationships
   - Rebuilds family tree from current vault data
   - Recalculates positions using family-chart layout engine
   - Preserves Obsidian's exact JSON formatting

3. **Non-Destructive Updates:**
   - Updates canvas in-place (same file, same location)
   - Uses current relationship data from person notes
   - Applies current spacing/sizing settings
   - Shows success notification with person count

**Use Cases:**
- Update tree after editing relationships in person notes
- Apply new spacing settings to existing canvases

- `main.ts` - Added `formatCanvasJson()` helper (lines 321-358)
- `main.ts` - Added file-menu context integration
- `main.ts` - Added command registration
- `src/ui/relayout-options-modal.ts` - Modal for re-layout direction selection

**Technical Details:**

- Detects root person automatically (first person note with cr_id)
- Applies 100ms delay when opening canvas before re-layout
- Formats JSON with tabs and compact objects to match Obsidian format
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly notices

### Canvas Metadata & Smart Re-layout (2025-11-22)

**Added:** Embedded generation metadata in canvas files to enable intelligent re-layout with preserved settings.

**Implemented Features:**

1. **Canvas Generation Metadata:**
   - Stores complete generation parameters in canvas frontmatter
   - Metadata includes: root person (cr_id and name), tree type, max generations, spouse inclusion, layout direction, timestamp
   - Layout settings preserved: node dimensions, horizontal/vertical spacing
   - Metadata format compatible with Obsidian Canvas JSON specification

2. **Smart Re-Layout with Settings Preservation:**
   - Re-layout modal reads original generation settings from canvas metadata
   - Displays original settings to user: "Originally generated as 'full' tree from Thomas Wilson with direction: vertical"
   - Preserves all original settings (tree type, generations, spouses) when re-layouting
   - Only allows changing layout direction (vertical ↔ horizontal)
   - Maintains generation timestamp for tracking

3. **Metadata Infrastructure:**
   - `CanvasRootsMetadata` interface in canvas-generator.ts defines metadata schema
   - Metadata embedded in canvas JSON at generation time (both Control Center and Generate All Trees)
   - `formatCanvasJson()` methods properly serialize metadata to frontmatter
   - Re-layout reads metadata and passes to canvas generator to preserve settings

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/canvas-generator.ts` - Added `CanvasRootsMetadata` interface, metadata logging, metadata embedding in canvas output
- `src/ui/control-center.ts` - Added metadata to `handleTreeGeneration()` and `openAndGenerateAllTrees()`, fixed `formatCanvasJson()` to serialize frontmatter
- `main.ts` - Updated `relayoutCanvas()` to read and use stored metadata, fixed `formatCanvasJson()` to serialize frontmatter
- `src/ui/relayout-options-modal.ts` - Enhanced modal to read and display original generation settings from metadata

**Technical Details:**
- Metadata stored in standard Obsidian Canvas `metadata.frontmatter` field as `Record<string, unknown>`
- TypeScript literal types (`as const`) ensure type safety for fixed values like 'canvas-roots', 'full', 'vertical'
- Uses plugin's structured logging system (`getLogger('CanvasGenerator')`) instead of console.log
- Metadata passed through generation pipeline via `canvasRootsMetadata` option parameter
- JSON serialization via `JSON.stringify()` for nested metadata object

**Use Cases:**
- Preserve complex tree configurations when switching between vertical/horizontal layouts
- Track when and how each canvas was generated for audit trail
- Enable future "regenerate with same settings" functionality
- Support canvas versioning and migration in future updates

**Documentation Updated:**
- `docs/specification.md` - Updated Tree Generation Tab section with new layout
- `README.md` - Updated workflow instructions for new streamlined process

**UX Benefits:**
- No modal switching required - entire workflow in one view
- Primary action impossible to miss (large button at top)
- Clear distinction between single-tree and multi-tree workflows
- Faster person selection with inline filtering
- Better understanding of vault structure via family group detection

### Person Picker Enhancements (2025-11-20)

### Canvas Color Enhancements (2025-11-20)

**Enhanced:** Gender-based node coloring using all 6 available Canvas colors.

**Implemented Features:**
- **Gender Detection:** Reads `sex` or `gender` field from YAML frontmatter
  - Male (M/MALE): Canvas color 4 (Green)
  - Female (F/FEMALE): Canvas color 6 (Purple)
  - Unknown/Neutral: Canvas color 2 (Orange)
- **GEDCOM Compatibility:** Supports standard GEDCOM SEX tag values (M, F, U)
- **Fallback Support:** Legacy name-based detection (Mr., Mrs., etc.) still works
- **Enhanced Edge Colors:**
  - Parent-child relationships: Canvas color 1 (Red)
  - Spouse relationships: Canvas color 5 (Blue)
  - Default edges: Canvas color 3 (Yellow)

**Technical Details:**
- Added `sex` field to `PersonNode` interface
- Updated `extractPersonNode()` to extract sex/gender from frontmatter
- Enhanced `getPersonColor()` to prioritize frontmatter over name heuristics
- Updated `getEdgeColor()` to use more distinctive colors
- All 6 Obsidian Canvas colors now utilized for visual clarity

**Files Modified:**
- `src/core/family-graph.ts` - Added sex field to PersonNode interface and extraction
- `src/core/canvas-generator.ts` - Enhanced color assignment logic

**Benefits:**
- More accurate gender representation using GEDCOM-standard data
- Better visual differentiation using full color palette
- Maintains compatibility with existing vaults (graceful degradation)
- Prepares foundation for future customizable color schemes

### Privacy and Gender Identity Protection (2025-11-20)

**Enhanced:** Data model to support inclusive gender identity and privacy protection.

**Implemented Features:**
- **Gender vs Sex Separation:**
  - `sex`: GEDCOM-compatible biological sex field (M/F/U) for data interchange
  - `gender`: Free-form gender identity field (e.g., "Woman", "Non-binary", "Transgender man")
  - `pronouns`: Optional preferred pronouns (e.g., "she/her", "they/them", "he/him")
- **Deadname Protection:**
  - `name` field always represents current, chosen name
  - `_previous_names` array for historical names (underscore = private/sensitive)
  - Plugin will never display underscore-prefixed fields in UI or search
  - Export warnings when private fields are included
- **Privacy Field Convention:**
  - Any field with underscore prefix (`_`) is private/sensitive
  - Excluded from person picker, search results, canvas labels
  - Requires explicit confirmation for exports
  - Examples: `_previous_names`, `_medical_notes`, `_adoption_details`
- **Inclusive Language:**
  - All documentation and UI uses respectful, inclusive language
  - Designed to serve all users regardless of gender identity or family structure

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/specification.md` - Added §2.1.2 Privacy and Identity Protection section
- `docs/development.md` - This documentation

**Rationale:**
- Respects transgender and non-binary individuals' dignity
- Separates GEDCOM biological data from personal identity
- Protects sensitive historical information
- Aligns with LGBTQIA+ ally values and inclusive design principles

**Future Enhancements:**
- User preference settings for color coding (by sex, gender, or disabled)
- Privacy mode for exports (strip all underscore-prefixed fields)
- Pronoun support in custom reports and documentation generation

## Dual Storage System

The plugin implements a **dual storage pattern** for relationships to balance Obsidian features with reliable resolution:

### Frontmatter Structure

```yaml
---
cr_id: abc-123-def-456
name: John Smith
father: "[[Dad Smith]]"      # Wikilink (enables Obsidian features)
father_id: xyz-789-uvw-012   # cr_id (enables reliable resolution)
mother: "[[Mom Smith]]"
mother_id: pqr-345-stu-678
spouse:
  - "[[Jane Doe]]"
spouse_id:
  - mno-901-jkl-234
children:
  - "[[Child 1]]"
  - "[[Child 2]]"
children_id:
  - def-456-ghi-789
  - abc-123-xyz-456
---
```

### Benefits

1. **Wikilinks** (father/mother/spouse/children): Enable Obsidian's link graph, backlinks, and hover previews
2. **ID fields** (_id suffix): Provide reliable resolution that survives file renames

### Implementation

- **bidirectional-linker.ts**: Creates/updates both wikilink and _id fields when syncing relationships
- **family-graph.ts**: Reads from _id fields first, falls back to wikilink resolution for legacy support
- **gedcom-importer.ts**: Two-pass import: creates wikilinks in first pass, replaces with cr_ids in _id fields in second pass

## Debugging

### Logging System

The plugin includes a structured logging system with persistent configuration:

**Log Levels:**
- `debug`: Most verbose, shows all operations
- `info`: Important events and state changes
- `warn`: Warnings and non-critical issues
- `error`: Errors and failures
- `off`: Disable logging

**Configuration:**
1. Open Settings → Canvas Roots
2. Navigate to "Logging" section
3. Select desired log level from dropdown
4. Changes apply immediately and persist across Obsidian restarts

**Default Setting:** Debug mode is enabled by default for development visibility.

**Exporting Logs:**
The logging system captures structured log entries that can be exported via the Control Center's Status tab for debugging complex issues.

### Console Logs
Open the Developer Console in Obsidian:
- Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+I
- Mac: Cmd+Option+I

Look for:
- "Loading Canvas Roots plugin" when the plugin loads
- Structured log entries with component names and operation contexts
- Any error messages or stack traces

### TypeScript Errors
The build command includes type checking:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will show any TypeScript errors before building.

## Version Management

When ready to release a new version:

1. Update the version in `package.json`
2. Run the version bump script:
   ```bash
   npm version patch  # or minor, or major
   ```

This will automatically update `manifest.json` and `versions.json`.
