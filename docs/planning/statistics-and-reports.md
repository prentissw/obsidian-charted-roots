# Statistics & Reports

## Overview

A unified statistics and reporting system with a shared data layer. The Statistics Dashboard provides at-a-glance metrics and monitoring, while Reports generate formatted output from the same underlying data. This architecture ensures consistency and avoids duplicate computation.

See [Roadmap: Statistics & Reports](../../wiki-content/Roadmap.md#statistics--reports) for the user-facing summary.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              StatisticsService                       │
│  (computes all metrics, caches results)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  - entityCounts()      - qualityMetrics()           │
│  - completenessScores() - demographicAnalysis()     │
│  - topLists(category)   - sourceCoverage()          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
           │                          │
           ▼                          ▼
┌─────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────────┐
│  Statistics Tab     │    │  Reports Tab            │
│  (Control Center)   │    │  (Control Center)       │
│  + Workspace View   │    │  (formatted output)     │
└─────────────────────┘    └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for all metrics
- Dashboard provides immediate value and acts as "preview"
- Reports become formatted views of existing data
- Drill-down from dashboard metrics to detailed reports

## UI Architecture: Hybrid Approach

The system uses a **hybrid UI** that combines quick access in Control Center with deep exploration in a dedicated workspace view:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Control Center → Statistics Tab (Summary Card)                  │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐│

**Why This Approach:**

| Aspect | Control Center Tab | Workspace View |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Quick health check | Deep exploration |
| **Persistence** | Modal (closes when done) | Pinnable (stays open) |
| **Refresh** | Manual | Auto-refresh on vault changes |
| **Detail level** | Summary metrics only | Full drill-down capability |
| **Workflow** | "Check stats, take action" | "Monitor while working" |

**Aligns with Obsidian Patterns:**
- Similar to Graph View: Status bar shows node count → Graph View shows full visualization
- Similar to Backlinks: Panel shows count → Dedicated view shows all links
- Control Center remains action-oriented; workspace view enables monitoring

---

## Statistics Dashboard

### Statistics Service

Core service that computes all metrics with caching and debounced refresh:

```typescript
interface StatisticsService {
  // Entity counts
  getEntityCounts(): EntityCounts;
  getEntityCountsByType(entityType: string): Map<string, number>;

  // Completeness
  getCompletenessScores(): CompletenessScores;
  getMissingVitals(): PersonNote[];

  // Quality metrics
  getUnsourcedFacts(): EventNote[];
  getOrphanEntities(): EntityNote[];
  getDuplicateCandidates(): DuplicatePair[];

  // Top lists
  getTopSurnames(limit?: number): SurnameCount[];
  getTopLocations(limit?: number): LocationCount[];
  getTopOccupations(limit?: number): OccupationCount[];
  getTopSources(limit?: number): SourceCount[];

  // Demographics (Phase 3)
  getGenderDistribution(): GenderDistribution;
  getAgeStatistics(): AgeStatistics;
  getMigrationPatterns(): MigrationPattern[];

  // Cache management
  invalidateCache(): void;
  getCacheAge(): number;
}
```

### Control Center Summary Card

Quick-glance metrics in the Statistics tab:

- Entity counts (people, events, sources, places, organizations)
- Research completeness % with progress bar
- Quick warning indicators (missing vitals, unsourced facts)
- "Open Statistics Dashboard" button → opens workspace view

### Workspace View Dashboard

Full statistics dashboard with drill-down capabilities:

**Entity Overview:**

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Entity counts** | People, events, sources, places, organizations by type |
| **Completeness scores** | % of people with birth date, death date, at least one source |
| **Date range** | Earliest to latest dates across all entities |
| **Gender/sex breakdown** | Distribution with chart visualization |

**Top Lists:**

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Top surnames** | Most common surnames with counts |
| **Top locations** | Most referenced places (birth, death, residence) |
| **Top occupations** | Most common occupations |
| **Top sources** | Most-cited sources |

**Quality Metrics:**

| Statistic | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Unsourced facts** | Count of events without source citations |
| **Orphan entities** | Events/sources not linked to any person |
| **Missing vitals** | People missing birth or death dates |
| **Duplicate candidates** | Potential duplicates by name similarity |

**UI Features:**
- Summary cards at top (entity counts, completeness %)
- Expandable sections by category
- Charts for distributions (bar charts, pie charts)
- **Drill-down links**: Click any metric → opens filtered report or entity list
- Auto-refreshes when vault changes (debounced)
- Can be pinned alongside notes in split view

### Dashboard → Report Integration

The dashboard and reports share filtering and link directly:

| Dashboard Metric | Current Behavior | Future Report |
|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Top surnames | Expands inline → shows people → click opens note | Surname Report |
| Top locations | Expands inline → shows people → click opens note | Place Report |
| Top occupations | Expands inline → shows people → click opens note | — |
| Top sources | Click → opens source note directly | Source Bibliography |
| Reports section | Click report type → opens generator modal | — |

**Current Flow (Implemented):**
1. Dashboard shows "Top Surnames: Smith (45)"
2. Click → Expands inline to show all 45 people as clickable chips
3. Click person → Opens their note in new tab

**Future Enhancement:**
- Quality alerts could link to filtered Gaps Report
- Extended statistics could link to demographic reports

### Data Model Considerations

#### Existing Fields (No Changes Needed)

These reports work with the current data model:

- Family Group Sheet, Individual Summary, Ahnentafel, Register, Pedigree, Descendant
- Character Sheet, Cast List, Organization Roster, Faction Timeline
- Age Audit, Lifespan Overlap
- Source Bibliography, Evidence Matrix
- Character Arc (uses events filtered by person)
- Subplot Timeline (uses `groups` field on events)

#### Optional Schema Extensions

These fields would enhance certain reports but are not required:

| Field | On Entity | Used By | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| `book` | Event | Scene Outline, Appearances by Book | Book/volume identifier |
| `chapter` | Event | Scene Outline | Chapter number or name |
| `pov_character` | Event | POV Coverage | Which character "sees" this event |
| `arc_status` | Group/Event | Subplot Timeline | setup / rising / climax / resolution |

Users who don't need these reports don't need these fields. Reports gracefully degrade when fields are absent.

### Output Formats

#### Markdown (Primary)

- Standard output format
- Contains wikilinks for Obsidian integration
- Embeddable in other notes
- Searchable and linkable

#### PDF (via Browser Print)

- Reports include print-optimized CSS
- Users print via Ctrl/Cmd+P → Save as PDF
- Clean layout with hidden navigation elements
- Page breaks at logical sections

#### Dataview Query (Dynamic)

Instead of a static snapshot, generate a Dataview query that produces the report dynamically:

```markdown
## Family Group Sheet: Smith-Jones

```dataview
TABLE
  born as "Born",
  died as "Died",
  birthPlace as "Birthplace"
FROM "People"
WHERE father = [[John Smith]] OR mother = [[Mary Jones]]
SORT born ASC
```
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Statistics Dashboard ✅

**Status:** Complete

**Focus:** Core statistics infrastructure and dashboard.

1. **StatisticsService** ✅
   - Entity counts with caching
   - Completeness scores
   - Quality metrics (missing vitals, unsourced facts)
   - Top lists (surnames, locations, occupations, sources)
   - Debounced cache invalidation on vault changes

2. **Control Center Summary Card** ✅
   - Entity count display
   - Completeness progress bars
   - Warning indicators
   - "Open Statistics Dashboard" button

3. **Statistics Workspace View** ✅
   - Full dashboard with expandable sections
   - Charts for distributions
   - Auto-refresh on vault changes
   - Split view support

4. **Drill-Down** ✅
   - Top lists (surnames, locations, occupations) expand inline to show matching people
   - Click person chip → opens their note in new tab
   - Top sources link directly to source notes

### Phase 2: Reports Generator ✅

**Status:** Complete

**Focus:** Core genealogy reports that are most requested.

1. **Family Group Sheet** ✅
   - Select a couple or individual
   - Show spouse(s), children with basic vitals
   - Include source citations

2. **Individual Summary** ✅
   - All known facts for one person
   - Events in chronological order
   - Source citations per fact

3. **Ahnentafel Report** ✅
   - Numbered ancestor list
   - Configurable generation depth
   - Standard genealogical format

4. **Gaps Report** ✅
   - Missing vital records by generation
   - Linked from dashboard "Missing Vitals" metric

**Infrastructure:** ✅
- Report generation service
- Markdown templating system
- Reports section in Statistics Dashboard
- Report generator modal with preview

### Phase 3: Extended Statistics ✅

**Status:** Complete

**Focus:** Demographics, source coverage, worldbuilding metrics.

- ✅ Longevity analysis (average lifespan by birth decade and location)
- ✅ Family size patterns (average children per family by decade)
- ✅ Marriage patterns (age at marriage by sex, remarriage rates)
- ✅ Migration flows (birth-to-death location changes, top routes)
- ✅ Source coverage by generation
- ✅ Timeline density (events per decade with gap detection)

### Phase 4: Additional Reports ✅

**Status:** Complete

**Focus:** Expand to all report types.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Register Report (NGSQ-style descendant numbering)
- ✅ Pedigree Chart (markdown ancestor tree)
- ✅ Descendant Chart (markdown descendant tree)

**Future:**
- Character Sheet, Cast List, Organization Roster
- Character Arc, Scene Outline, POV Coverage
- Source Bibliography, Evidence Matrix
- Faction Timeline, Age Audit, Lifespan Overlap
- Dataview query generation

### Phase 5: Quality Drill-Down ✅

**Status:** Complete

**Focus:** Enhanced data quality section with drill-down and additional metrics.

**Bug Fix:**
- ✅ Fixed orphaned people calculation (was returning negative values due to incorrect subtraction of overlapping sets)

**New Quality Metrics:**
- ✅ Missing death dates (people with birth but no death, excluding living)
- ✅ Incomplete parents (people with only one parent linked)
- ✅ Date inconsistencies (birth after death, age > 120)

**Drill-Down Support:**
- ✅ All quality issues are now clickable and expandable
- ✅ Click to expand → shows affected people/items as clickable chips
- ✅ Right-click context menu (open to right, new window)
- ✅ Ctrl+hover for preview
- ✅ Severity levels: error (red), warning (orange), info (blue)
- ✅ Scrollable drill-down list (max 50 items with "...and X more" indicator)

### Future: Enhanced Drill-Down

**Focus:** Advanced drill-down capabilities beyond viewing.

- **Edit via modal**: Click person in drill-down → open edit modal instead of just navigating to note
- **Batch operations**: Select multiple people from drill-down → apply bulk edits (e.g., fix common spelling)
- **Context menu**: Right-click person chip → options: Open, Edit, Add to collection, etc.
- **Extended drill-down targets**: Events by type, sources by type, places by category

## Technical Considerations

### Statistics Service Architecture

```typescript
interface StatisticsCache {
  entityCounts?: EntityCounts;
  completenessScores?: CompletenessScores;
  topLists?: TopListsCache;
  lastUpdated: number;
}

class StatisticsService {
  private cache: StatisticsCache;
  private refreshDebounceMs = 1000;

  constructor(private plugin: CanvasRootsPlugin) {
    // Register vault change listeners
    this.plugin.registerEvent(
      this.plugin.app.vault.on('modify', this.scheduleRefresh.bind(this))
    );
  }

  private scheduleRefresh(): void {
    // Debounced cache invalidation
  }
}
```

### Report Generator Architecture

```typescript
interface ReportGenerator<TOptions, TResult> {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly name: string;
  readonly category: 'genealogy' | 'worldbuilding' | 'writing' | 'historian';

  getDefaultOptions(): TOptions;
  validate(options: TOptions): ValidationResult;
  generate(options: TOptions): Promise<TResult>;
  toMarkdown(result: TResult): string;
  toDataviewQuery?(result: TResult): string;
}

// Example: Family Group Sheet
class FamilyGroupSheetGenerator implements ReportGenerator<FGSOptions, FGSResult> {
  // ...
}
```

### Leveraging Existing Services

| Service | Used By |
|---------|---------|
| `FamilyGraphService` | Statistics (entity counts), Family Group Sheet, Ahnentafel, Pedigree |
