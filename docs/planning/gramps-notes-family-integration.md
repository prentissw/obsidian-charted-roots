# Gramps Notes & Family Entity Integration

Planning document for Gramps notes import/export and potentially introducing a Family entity type.

**Status:** Planning
**GitHub Issue:** #TBD
**Priority:** Medium
**Created:** 2025-12-26
**Updated:** 2025-12-27

---

## Overview

Gramps allows attaching notes to various entities (people, families, events, places, sources, etc.). These notes are free-form text that can contain research notes, biographical information, source transcriptions, and more. Users importing from Gramps expect their notes to be preserved.

Additionally, Gramps treats families as first-class entities with their own notes and metadata. This raises the question of whether Canvas Roots should introduce a Family entity type to properly support this data.

---

## Design Principles

Canvas Roots serves a diverse user base. Many users come from GEDCOM files or start fresh in Obsidian — they may never touch Gramps and have no need for advanced sync or note-sharing features.

**Guiding principles for this feature:**

1. **Start conservatively** — Begin with the simplest implementation that meets core needs
2. **Opt-in for advanced features** — Complex capabilities (separate note files, Family entities, sync support) should be optional settings, not defaults
3. **Don't disrupt simple workflows** — Users with basic requirements should not see added complexity
4. **Preserve data** — All Gramps metadata should be captured, even if not immediately used, to enable future features and round-tripping

## User Feedback

Forum discussion: https://gramps.discourse.group/t/genealogy-research-in-obsidian-for-those-who-want-to-try/8926/4

A Gramps user provided detailed feedback suggesting:

1. **Notes as first-class entities** — Each note should be an independent file, not embedded text
2. **Preserve all metadata** — Note types, privacy flags, and other attributes in frontmatter
3. **Per-object folder structure** — Each entity gets a folder with subfolders for notes
4. **Family notes support** — Families should have their own Markdown files
5. **Internal/external links** — Convert Gramps object references to wikilinks
6. **Bi-directional sync** — Support for syncing changes back to Gramps
7. **Privacy flag handling** — Respect private flags, especially for synced vaults
8. **Link back to Gramps** — Obsidian files as media objects in Gramps

**User feedback received (2025-12-27):** See `docs/user-feedback/user-feedback-03.md`

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Notes shared across entities? | **Yes, frequently.** Uses `[[{doc}\|Alias]]` format with redundant "Notes" sections for control. | Phase 4 (separate note files) important for this user |
| Family notes use case? | Same as any entity — info that can't attach elsewhere, research docs, links | Phase 3 (Family entity) needed |
| One-time import or sync? | **Advanced hybrid.** Obsidian is "hub" connecting tools; plans Python scripts for bi-directional sync | Phase 5 eventually needed; preserve handles |
| Privacy flag triggers? | Manual control preferred; just add the YAML key for extensibility | Phase 1 approach is correct |
| Obsidian Sync / publishing? | No Sync; looking at export-to-website plugins; wants total control over what leaves computer | Privacy flag as frontmatter sufficient |

**Takeaway:** This is a power user. Simpler users may still benefit from Phase 1's embedded approach, but the phased plan is validated — each phase serves real needs.

**User feedback received (2025-12-27):** [GitHub issue #36 comment](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/36#issuecomment-3694263634)

| Question | Answer | Implication |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Where should notes appear? | Appended to note content | Phase 1 approach is correct |
| Multiple notes organization? | Separate subsections by note type | Phase 1 approach is correct |
| Preserve note types? | Yes, as subsection headers (e.g., `### Research`) | Phase 1 approach is correct |
| Formatted notes handling? | Convert Gramps styling to Markdown | Need style conversion in Phase 1 |
| Private notes handling? | Import and add `private: true` to frontmatter | Phase 1 approach is correct |
| Default behavior? | Notes import enabled by default | Phase 1 approach is correct |
| Family notes? | **Attach to marriage event** | Alternative to Phase 3 Family entity |

**Takeaway:** This user prefers the simpler embedded approach (Phase 1) and suggests attaching family notes to marriage events rather than creating a separate Family entity. This validates Phase 1 as the default and suggests Phase 3 (Family entity) should remain opt-in for power users who need it.

**Additional feedback (2025-12-27):** https://gramps.discourse.group/t/genealogy-research-in-obsidian-for-those-who-want-to-try/8926/8

Same user shared screenshots of their Obsidian vault structure:

| Observation | Details | Implication |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **"More is less" philosophy** | Advocates importing everything from GEDCOM/Gramps — users can discover new relationships in Obsidian that genealogy software can't show | Validates preserving all data; don't filter during import |
| **Numbered folder prefixes** | Uses `10. People`, `20. Families & Kinships`, `30. Events`, etc. for ordering | Consider optional numbered prefix support |
| **Extended entity types** | Has `Ships & Vessels`, `Companies` as separate folders beyond our standard types | Organization entity can cover Companies; Ships could be custom type |
| **Research Logs** | Dedicated `Research Logs for People` folder with per-person logs | Potential future entity type; relates to Research Tracking in Roadmap |
| **"People of Interest"** | Separates main research subjects from peripheral people | Could use `status` field or collections to distinguish |
| **Rich person note sections** | Family & Kinship (with Foster Parents, Grand Parents subsections), History, Events, Occupations, Notes | Our dynamic blocks cover some; person note templates could help |
| **Status property** | Uses `status: Object of Research` in frontmatter | Not currently in our schema; could add |
| **Multiple alias variants** | Stores many name variations | Aligns with our existing `aliases` field |
| **Hierarchical archives** | Organizes by country code + repository (NO/SAO = Norway/State Archive Oslo) | Aligns with our place hierarchy and source organization |

**Takeaway:** This user operates at power-user level, using tools outside intended purpose. Their elaborate structure is aspirational rather than minimum requirement, but validates our phased approach and "preserve everything" principle.

## Background Research

### Gramps Note Structure (from grampsxml.dtd)

```xml
<!ELEMENT note (text, style*, tagref*)>
<!ATTLIST note
        id        CDATA #IMPLIED
        handle    ID    #REQUIRED
        priv      (0|1) #IMPLIED
        change    CDATA #REQUIRED
        format    (0|1) #IMPLIED
        type      CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!ELEMENT noteref EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST noteref hlink IDREF #REQUIRED>
```

### Gramps Family Structure (from grampsxml.dtd)

```xml
<!ELEMENT family (rel?, father?, mother?, eventref*, lds_ord*, objref*,
                  childref*, attribute*, noteref*, citationref*, tagref*)>
<!ATTLIST family
        id        CDATA #IMPLIED
        handle    ID    #REQUIRED
        priv      (0|1) #IMPLIED
        change    CDATA #REQUIRED
>
```

### Entities That Can Have Notes

According to the DTD, the following elements can contain `noteref`:
- **person** - directly and within names, addresses, person references
- **family** - directly and within child references
- **event** - directly
- **place** (placeobj) - directly
- **source** - directly (already implemented!)
- **citation** - directly
- **object** (media) - directly
- **repository** - directly

### Note Types

Common note types in Gramps:
- Person Note
- Research
- Transcript
- Source text
- Citation
- General
- Custom user-defined types

### Current Implementation

- Notes are already parsed in `gramps-parser.ts` (line 480-487)
- Notes are stored in `database.notes` Map
- Source notes are already resolved and used (line 359-370)
- `GrampsPerson` type does not currently include `noteRefs`
- `GrampsFamily` is parsed but only used to derive person relationships
- Canvas Roots has no Family entity — relationships are properties on Person notes

---

## Proposed Implementation

### Phase 1: Embedded Person Notes (Conservative)

The simplest approach that meets core needs.

1. **Extend `GrampsPerson` interface**
   - Add `noteRefs: string[]` field

2. **Parse person note references**
   - In `parsePerson()`, extract `noteref` elements
   - Store handle references in `noteRefs` array

3. **Add import option**
   - Add `importNotes: boolean` to `GrampsImportOptions`
   - Default: enabled (notes are valuable data)
   - Add toggle in Import Wizard UI

4. **Append notes to person content**
   - Add "## Notes" section at bottom of person note
   - Include note type as subsection header if multiple notes
   - Preserve note text content
   - Add `private: true` to frontmatter if any note has `priv="1"`

5. **Preserve metadata**
   - Note type as header: `### Research Note`
   - Private flag as frontmatter property

### Phase 2: Other Entity Notes

Extend the embedded approach to other entities.

- Event notes → append to event note content
- Place notes → append to place note content
- Source notes → already implemented
- Family notes → see Phase 3

### Phase 3: Family Entity (Advanced, Opt-in)

Introduce Family as a new entity type in Canvas Roots.

**Motivation:**
- Natural home for family-level notes
- Matches Gramps/GEDCOM mental model
- Place for marriage events, shared research, household information

**Implementation:**
- Add `cr_type: family` entity type
- Create `Families/` folder during import
- Family note includes:
  - Parents (wikilinks to Person notes)
  - Children (wikilinks to Person notes)
  - Marriage/partnership events
  - Family notes section
- Add to Bases templates

**Trade-offs:**
- Adds complexity to the data model
- Some information becomes duplicated (parent/child relationships exist on both Person and Family)
- Requires new UI components, service layer, etc.

**Should be opt-in:** Import wizard checkbox "Create family notes" (default: off)

**Alternative: Attach to Marriage Event**

User feedback suggests a simpler approach: attach family notes to the marriage/partnership event instead of creating a separate Family entity. This avoids adding a new entity type while still preserving the notes.

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Family entity | Matches Gramps model; dedicated place for family-level data | Adds complexity; duplicates relationship data |
| Marriage event | Simpler; no new entity type; already have events | Family notes without marriage event have no home; less organized |

**Recommendation:** Default to "attach to marriage event" approach. Offer Family entity as opt-in for power users who need full Gramps fidelity.

### Phase 4: Separate Note Files (Advanced, Opt-in)

For users who need notes as independent, linkable entities.

- Each Gramps note becomes its own Markdown file in a `Notes/` folder
- Parent entity links to note files instead of embedding content
- Enables note sharing across multiple entities
- Required for accurate round-trip sync to Gramps

**Should be opt-in:** Import wizard checkbox "Create separate note files" (default: off)

### Phase 5: Export & Sync (Future)

Support for exporting notes back to Gramps and potentially bi-directional sync.

**User feedback suggests:**
- `sync-status: draft | synced | ignore` frontmatter field to control what gets pushed back
- Dedicated folder structure makes change detection easier
- Obsidian note files could be linked as media objects in Gramps

**Requirements for round-trip support:**
- Preserve Gramps handles (`gramps_handle` in frontmatter) - already done for some entities
- Avoid lossy transformations during import
- Track which notes were created in Obsidian vs. imported from Gramps
- Handle conflicts (same note edited in both places)

**Implementation considerations:**
- Requires Phase 4 (separate note files) for accurate note-level sync
- May require Phase 3 (Family entity) to preserve family-level notes
- Export would extend existing Gramps XML export functionality
- True "sync" is complex; "export changes" is more tractable

**Status:** Deferred. Capture requirements now, implement after Phases 1-4 are stable and user feedback confirms demand.

## Privacy Handling

The `priv` attribute on Gramps notes indicates private/sensitive content.

**Options:**

1. **Frontmatter flag only** (Phase 1)
   - Add `private: true` to entity frontmatter if any attached note is private
   - User responsible for configuring sync/publish exclusions
   - Simple but not foolproof

2. **Separate folder** (Phase 3+)
   - Private notes go in a `Private/` folder
   - Easier to exclude from sync via folder rules
   - More robust but changes file organization

3. **Skip private notes**
   - Don't import notes marked private
   - Add import option: "Skip private notes"
   - Safest for shared vaults but loses data

**Recommendation:** Start with option 1, add options 2-3 as advanced settings.

## Open Questions

### Resolved

1. **Where should notes appear in person notes?**
   → Phase 1: Bottom of note content (after dynamic blocks), as "## Notes" section
   → Phase 4: Separate note files with full metadata in frontmatter (user-preferred approach for round-tripping)

   *Note: Phase 1's embedded approach trades some metadata fidelity for simplicity. Users needing full Gramps metadata preservation (handles, per-note privacy flags) should use Phase 4.*

2. **How to handle multiple notes per person?**
   → Separate subsections by note type

3. **Should note type be preserved?**
   → Yes, as header: `### Research Note`

4. **Default behavior?**
   → Notes import enabled by default (valuable data); Family entity and separate files are opt-in

5. **How to handle styled/formatted notes?**
   → Phase 1: Import plain text only
   → Phase 2+: Add style conversion for basic types (bold, italic, strikethrough, links)

   **Gramps style types** (from `StyledTextTagType`):
   | Type | Markdown equivalent |
   |------|---------------------|
   | BOLD | `**text**` |
   | ITALIC | `*text*` |
   | UNDERLINE | `<u>text</u>` (HTML) or skip |
   | STRIKETHROUGH | `~~text~~` |
   | SUPERSCRIPT | `<sup>text</sup>` |
   | SUBSCRIPT | `<sub>text</sub>` |
   | LINK | `[text](url)` |
   | FONTFACE, FONTSIZE, FONTCOLOR, HIGHLIGHT | Skip (no Markdown equivalent) |

6. **The `format` attribute**
   → `format="0"` (FLOWED) → normal Markdown text
   → `format="1"` (FORMATTED) → wrap in code fence or preserve whitespace

7. **Note tags (`tagref`)**
   → Store in frontmatter array: `gramps_tags: [research, todo]`
   → Preserves data without polluting Obsidian tag namespace
   → Users can convert to Obsidian tags manually if desired

### Still Open

*None currently — all questions resolved.*

### Resolved by User Feedback

4. **Note sharing patterns?**
   → **Frequently shared.** User uses wikilinks with aliases and redundant "Notes" sections.
   → Phase 4 (separate note files) is important for power users; Phase 1 still valuable for simpler workflows.

5. **Family entity adoption**
   → **Needed.** User treats family notes same as any other entity type.
   → Phase 3 should proceed as planned.
