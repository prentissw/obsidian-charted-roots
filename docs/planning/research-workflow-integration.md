## Overview

Enable genealogists to manage research workflow using GPS (Genealogical Proof Standard) methodology within Charted Roots. This integration provides entity types, hierarchical organization, and workflow tracking without forcing users into rigid structures.

### Goals

1. **Support GPS methodology** — Align with Mills' Evidence Explained research practices
2. **Maintain flexibility** — Users can adopt features selectively without enforcement
3. **Avoid duplication** — Single cohesive system, not overlapping features
4. **Integrate with existing features** — Leverage Data Quality, schema validation, conflict detection
5. **Minimize vault bloat** — Lightweight entities, optional features

### Non-Goals

- Replacing user's existing research system wholesale
- Enforcing specific folder structures or naming conventions
- Auto-generating complex analysis or conclusions
- Task management (users can integrate with Obsidian Tasks/DataView)

## Research Question

Was John Smith (b. ~1850) who married Mary Jones in 1875 the same person as John Smith enumerated in 1860 census?

## Research Log

- **2026-01-04** — [[1860 Census - District 42]] — Searched "John Smith, age 10-12" → negative. Searched all pages, no match in expected age range.

- **2026-01-05** — [[Marriage Record - Smith-Jones 1875]] — Searched "John Smith parents" → positive. Parents listed as William and Elizabeth Smith.

## Related Reports

- [[Smith Identity Research Report]]
- [[Smith Family Group Analysis]]

# John Smith Birth Location Analysis

## Research Question

Where was John Smith (1850-1920) born?

## Sources Consulted

- [[1860 Census - Smith Household]]
- [[1875 Marriage Record - Smith-Jones]]
- [[Death Certificate - John Smith 1920]]

## Findings

### Census Evidence
The 1860 census shows John Smith (age 10) enumerated with William and Elizabeth Smith...

### Marriage Record Evidence
Marriage certificate states birthplace as "Pennsylvania"...

## Research Notes

**Negative Finding:** Searched Pennsylvania birth records 1845-1855 for John Smith with parents William and Elizabeth. No matches found in:
- Philadelphia County birth index
- Allegheny County birth index
- Lancaster County birth records

**Analysis:** Conflicting evidence between census (born NY) and marriage record (born PA) requires further investigation...

## Conclusions

[Analysis and synthesis]
```

### Individual Research Note (IRN)

**Purpose:** Synthesis document between research reports and person notes, combining analysis across multiple sources.

**Properties:**
```yaml
cr_type: individual_research_note
subject: "[[John Smith]]"

## Research Log Format

> **Note:** This section was revised to avoid nested/structured YAML, which causes compatibility issues with Obsidian's Properties editor, DataView, and Bases (#181).

Research logs appear in `## Research Log` sections within Research Projects. Use simple markdown bullet lists rather than structured YAML:

**Recommended Format:**

```markdown
## Research Log

- **2026-01-04** — [[1860 Census - District 42]] — Searched "John Smith, age 10-12" → negative. Searched all pages of district 42, no match in expected age range.

- **2026-01-05** — [[Marriage Record - Smith-Jones 1875]] — Searched "John Smith parents" → positive. Parents listed as William and Elizabeth Smith.

- **2026-01-06** — Searched "Elizabeth Smith maiden name" → negative. No records found in county index 1820-1850.
```

**Why not structured YAML?**

The original plan proposed nested YAML entries, but this approach has significant drawbacks:

- **No Obsidian Properties editor support** — Users can't edit via native UI
- **DataView/Bases incompatibility** — These tools query frontmatter, not embedded YAML in content
- **Parsing fragility** — Special characters, multi-line notes, or malformed YAML break things
- **Inconsistent with project direction** — We flattened nested membership properties in v0.19.5 (#181) for these reasons

**Simple markdown advantages:**

- Human-readable and editable
- No custom parsing required
- Works with text search
- Can still use DataView inline queries if needed
- Consistent with how most Obsidian users document research

**Negative Findings:** Document "searched X, found nothing" scenarios with `→ negative`. This tracks meaningful absence of expected records per Mills' methodology.

**Alternative: Separate log entry notes**

For users who need queryable research logs, consider creating separate notes for each entry:

```yaml
---
cr_type: research_log_entry
date: 2026-01-04
project: "[[Identity of John Smith Project]]"
source: "[[1860 Census - District 42]]"
searched_for: "John Smith, age 10-12"
result: negative
---

Searched all pages of district 42, no match in expected age range.
```

This approach uses flat frontmatter properties that work with DataView and Bases, at the cost of more files in the vault.

---

## Hierarchical Navigation

Research entities use `up` and `related` properties for flexible hierarchy:

**Example Hierarchy:**
```
Research Notebook/
├── Identity of John Smith Project (Research Project)
│   ├── Smith Identity Research Report (Research Report)
│   ├── Smith Birth Analysis Report (Research Report)
│   └── John Smith IRN (Individual Research Note)
│       └── John Smith (Person Note)
└── Sarah Jones Identity Project (Research Project)
    └── Jones Family Analysis (Research Report)
```

**Properties:**
- `up`: Points to parent in hierarchy (Research Report → Research Project)
- `related`: Lateral relationships (related projects, related reports)

**Navigation:**
- Charted Roots recognizes hierarchy for breadcrumb navigation
- No enforcement: users can organize files however they prefer
- Queries can surface cross-project relationships

---

## Phase 1: Foundation

**Status:** ✅ Complete (2026-01-15)

**Scope:** Basic entity recognition and schema support.

### 1. Entity Type Recognition

**Implementation:**
- Extend `EntityTypeManager` with new types: `research_project`, `research_report`, `individual_research_note`, `research_journal`
- Add icons for each type (research-specific)
- Include in note discovery index

**Schema Definitions:**
```typescript
// src/schemas/research-project-schema.ts
export const researchProjectSchema = {
  cr_type: { type: 'string', required: true, enum: ['research_project'] },
  title: { type: 'string', required: false },
  status: { type: 'string', required: false, enum: ['open', 'in-progress', 'on-hold', 'completed'] },
  research_level: { type: 'number', required: false, min: 0, max: 6 },
  private: { type: 'boolean', required: false },
  up: { type: 'wikilink', required: false },
  related: { type: 'wikilink[]', required: false }
};

// Similar schemas for research_report, individual_research_note, research_journal
```

### 2. Properties Support

**Implementation:**
- Add property aliases support for research entity properties
- Recognize `status`, `private`, `up`, `related` across all research types
- Add `reportTo` for research reports
- Add `subject` for IRNs
- Add `date`, `repositories` for research journals

### 3. Research Log Support

> **Note:** Research log parsing was removed from Phase 1 scope. See [Research Log Format](#research-log-format) for rationale.

**Implementation:**
- Research logs use simple markdown format (no custom parsing)
- Optional: Recognize `cr_type: research_log_entry` for users who prefer separate notes
- No structured YAML parsing in content sections

### 4. Data Quality Integration

**Implementation:**
- Add research entity filtering to Data Quality dashboard
- Filter by `status` (show only in-progress, exclude completed)
- Filter by `private` (exclude from exports)
- Count research entities in vault statistics

**Dashboard Card:**
```
Research Entities
─────────────────
4 Projects (2 in-progress, 1 on-hold, 1 completed)
12 Reports (8 draft, 3 review, 1 final)
6 IRNs (4 in-progress)
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Separate IRN from Person Note?

**Decision:** Individual Research Notes (IRNs) are separate entities, not embedded in person notes.

**Rationale:**
- **Separation of concerns:** IRNs contain analysis/synthesis; person notes contain structured data
- **Version control:** Research analysis can evolve without modifying person note
- **Audience:** IRNs may be marked private; person data remains in tree
- **GPS methodology:** Research notes document reasoning; person notes document facts

### Why Research Logs in Projects Instead of Separate Entities?

**Decision:** Research log entries are YAML within `## Research Log` section, not separate notes.

**Rationale:**
- **Lightweight:** Avoids creating hundreds of tiny log entry notes
- **Contextual:** Logs stay with related project
- **Queryable:** Still accessible via DataView/Bases
- **Optional:** Users can use Research Journals for daily tracking if preferred

### Why Support Both Research Journals and Research Logs?

**Decision:** Both are optional; users choose based on workflow preference.

**Rationale:**
- **Research Journals:** Daily/session-level tracking across projects
- **Research Logs:** Project-specific tracking within project note
- **Complementary:** Journals for "what I did today"; logs for "what I found for this project"
- **No enforcement:** Users can use neither, one, or both

### Why `up` Instead of `parent`?

**Decision:** Use `up` property for hierarchy navigation.

**Rationale:**
- **Consistency:** Matches organizational structure from Organization Notes feature
- **Bidirectional:** `up` points to parent; parent can list children in `related` or content
- **Flexibility:** Not enforced; recognized for navigation if present
- **Clarity:** "Up" is intuitive for hierarchy ("go up one level")
