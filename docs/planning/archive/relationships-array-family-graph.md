# Relationships Array in Family Graph

Planning document for integrating the `relationships` array with the family graph and canvas tree generation.

- **Status:** In Progress (Redesigning)
- **GitHub Issue:** [#41](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/41)
- **Priority:** High
- **Created:** 2025-12-27
- **Updated:** 2025-12-30

## Overview

Currently, the family graph and canvas tree generation only read direct frontmatter properties (`stepfather`, `adoptive_father`, etc.) and do not parse the `relationships` array. Users who define step-parents or adoptive parents via the relationships array don't see them on canvas trees.

**User report:** "i have noticed that you've stated that step and adoptive parents appear on the family view and canvas but based on my usage it doesnt seem to be the case? i suspect it's because to indicate that you have to use the relationships array and it's simply not rendering that"

## Current State

### What FamilyGraphService Reads

| Property | Supported | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `father` / `father_id` | Yes | Biological father |
| `mother` / `mother_id` | Yes | Biological mother |
| `stepfather` / `stepfather_id` | Yes | Can be array for multiple |
| `stepmother` / `stepmother_id` | Yes | Can be array for multiple |
| `adoptive_father` / `adoptive_father_id` | Yes | Single value |
| `adoptive_mother` / `adoptive_mother_id` | Yes | Single value |
| `spouse` / `spouse_id` | Yes | Can be array |
| `children` / `children_id` | Yes | Can be array |
| `relationships` array | **No** | Not parsed |

### What RelationshipService Parses

The `relationships` array is already parsed by `RelationshipService` for the Relationships dynamic block and statistics. The array format is:

```yaml
relationships:
  - type: adoptive_parent
    target: "[[John Doe]]"
    target_id: person_abc123
    from: 1850
    to: 1875
    notes: "Adopted after parents died"
```

### Built-in Relationship Types (Family-Relevant)

| Type ID | Name | Inverse | Category |
|---------|------|---------|----------|
| `step_parent` | Step-parent | `step_child` | legal |
| `step_child` | Step-child | `step_parent` | legal |
| `adoptive_parent` | Adoptive parent | `adopted_child` | legal |
| `adopted_child` | Adopted child | `adoptive_parent` | legal |
| `foster_parent` | Foster parent | `foster_child` | legal |
| `foster_child` | Foster child | `foster_parent` | legal |
| `guardian` | Guardian | `ward` | legal |
| `ward` | Ward | `guardian` | legal |

---

## Proposed Implementation

### Phase 1: Parse Relationships Array in FamilyGraphService

Extend `parsePersonFromFrontmatter()` to also check the `relationships` array for parent-type relationships.

**Mapping logic:**

| Relationship Type | Target Gender | Maps To |
|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| `step_parent` | male | `stepfatherCrIds` |
| `step_parent` | female | `stepmotherCrIds` |
| `step_parent` | unknown/other | `stepfatherCrIds` (or new generic array) |
| `adoptive_parent` | male | `adoptiveFatherCrId` |
| `adoptive_parent` | female | `adoptiveMotherCrId` |
| `foster_parent` | any | New: `fosterParentCrIds` |
| `guardian` | any | New: `guardianCrIds` |

**Gender detection:** Look up the target person's `gender` property to determine stepfather vs stepmother.

**Implementation location:** `src/core/family-graph.ts`, around line 1264 after adoptive parent parsing.

### Phase 2: Add Foster Parent and Guardian Support

Extend `FamilyGraphNode` interface:

```typescript
// Foster parent relationships
fosterFatherCrId?: string;
fosterMotherCrId?: string;
// OR generic:
fosterParentCrIds: string[];

// Guardian relationships
guardianCrIds: string[];
```

Update tree traversal methods to include these relationships (with distinct edge types and styling).

### Phase 3: Settings for Tree Inclusion

Add settings to control which relationship types appear on canvas trees:

```typescript
// In settings
treeIncludeStepParents: boolean;      // default: true (already supported)
treeIncludeAdoptiveParents: boolean;  // default: true (already supported)
treeIncludeFosterParents: boolean;    // default: false
treeIncludeGuardians: boolean;        // default: false
```

### Phase 4: Canvas Tree Styling

Use relationship type definitions (`lineStyle`, `color`) to style edges on canvas trees:
- Step-parents: dashed line (already implemented)
- Adoptive parents: dotted line (already implemented)
- Foster parents: solid line, different color
- Guardians: dashed line, different color

## Technical Details

### Files to Modify

**Phase 1:**
- `src/core/family-graph.ts`
  - Import `RelationshipService` or directly parse `relationships` array
  - Extend `parsePersonFromFrontmatter()` to check relationships array
  - Add helper to resolve target person's gender

**Phase 2:**
- `src/core/family-graph.ts`
  - Add `fosterParentCrIds` and `guardianCrIds` to `FamilyGraphNode`
  - Update `collectAncestors()` and `collectFullTree()` to traverse new relationships
  - Update edge creation with appropriate `relationshipTypeId`

**Phase 3:**
- `src/settings.ts` - Add tree inclusion settings
- `src/ui/control-center.ts` - Add settings UI
- `src/core/family-graph.ts` - Check settings when collecting relationships

**Phase 4:**
- `src/core/canvas-generator.ts` - Use relationship type styling for edges

### Considerations

1. **Performance:** Parsing relationships array adds iteration. Should be minimal impact since it's already iterated for RelationshipService.

2. **Bidirectional resolution:** If Alice has `relationships: [{type: step_parent, target: "[[Bob]]"}]`, should Bob automatically show Alice as step-child on his tree? Currently no — this would require inverse relationship resolution.

3. **Duplicate handling:** If someone specifies both `stepfather: "[[Bob]]"` AND `relationships: [{type: step_parent, target: "[[Bob]]"}]`, should deduplicate.

4. **Custom relationship types:** Users can define custom relationship types. Should only family-relevant types (categories: `family`, `legal`) be considered for tree inclusion?

---

## Workaround (Current)

Until this is implemented, users should use direct properties instead of the relationships array:

```yaml
# Instead of:
relationships:
  - type: adoptive_parent
    target: "[[John Doe]]"

# Use:
adoptive_father: "[[John Doe]]"
# or
adoptive_mother: "[[John Doe]]"
```

---

## Open Questions

1. **Foster parents on trees?** Should foster parents appear on canvas trees by default, or only when explicitly enabled?

2. **Guardians on trees?** Guardians are often temporary/legal rather than familial. Should they appear on family trees at all, or only on a separate "legal relationships" view?

3. **Custom parent types?** If a user defines a custom relationship type like `milk_mother` (wet nurse who also acts as surrogate mother), should there be a way to mark it as "include on family tree"?

---

## Design Decisions (2025-12-30)

### Gender-Neutral Parents Integration

When the Inclusive Parents feature is enabled (v0.18.7+), `relationships` array entries with type `parent` should map to the `parents`/`parents_id` fields:

| Relationship Type | Target Sex | Maps To |
|-------------------|------------|---------|
| `parent` | any | `parentsCrIds` (gender-neutral) |
| `step_parent` | M | `stepfatherCrIds` |
| `step_parent` | F | `stepmotherCrIds` |
| `adoptive_parent` | M | `adoptiveFatherCrId` |
| `adoptive_parent` | F | `adoptiveMotherCrId` |

This maintains consistency - if users enable inclusive parents and use `parent` in the relationships array, it populates `parents`/`parents_id` just like the direct property.

### `includeOnFamilyTree` Flag for Relationship Types

Add new properties to `RelationshipTypeDefinition`:

```typescript
interface RelationshipTypeDefinition {
  // existing fields...

  /** Whether this relationship type should appear on family trees/charts */
  includeOnFamilyTree?: boolean;  // default: false for safety

  /** Which family graph property this maps to (for parent-like types) */
  familyGraphMapping?: 'parent' | 'stepparent' | 'adoptive_parent' | 'foster_parent' | 'guardian' | 'spouse' | 'child';
}
```

**Default values for built-in types:**

| Type | `includeOnFamilyTree` | `familyGraphMapping` |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `step_parent` | `true` | `stepparent` |
| `step_child` | `true` | `child` |
| `adoptive_parent` | `true` | `adoptive_parent` |
| `adopted_child` | `true` | `child` |
| `foster_parent` | `false` | `foster_parent` |
| `foster_child` | `false` | `child` |
| `guardian` | `false` | `guardian` |
| `ward` | `false` | `child` |
| `parent` | `true` | `parent` |
| Custom types | `false` | `undefined` |

This keeps it **opt-in** - custom relationship types won't appear on trees unless the user explicitly sets `includeOnFamilyTree: true` in their custom type definition.

### Benefits

1. **Opt-in by default** - Custom types don't unexpectedly appear on trees
2. **Explicit mapping** - `familyGraphMapping` clearly defines how types integrate with the graph
3. **User control** - Users can enable tree inclusion for custom types they create
4. **Backward compatible** - Existing direct properties continue to work

## Flat Properties Redesign (2025-12-30)

### Problem with Nested `relationships` Array

The current `relationships` array uses nested objects which are **incompatible with Obsidian's Properties UI**:

```yaml
# Current (NESTED - incompatible with Properties UI)
relationships:
  - type: godparent
    target: "[[John Smith]]"
    target_id: john_123
    from: "1850"
    notes: "Baptism sponsor"
```

This causes:
- "Type mismatch" warnings in Properties panel
- Risk of data corruption if user clicks "update"
- Poor UX - users can't edit relationships through Obsidian's native UI

### Flat Properties Design

Replace the nested array with **individual properties per relationship type**, following the existing pattern used for family relationships (`spouse`, `stepfather`, etc.):

```yaml
# NEW (FLAT - Obsidian compatible)
godparent: ["[[John Smith]]"]
godparent_id: ["john_123"]

# Multiple relationships of same type
mentor: ["[[Alice Brown]]", "[[Bob Jones]]"]
mentor_id: ["alice_456", "bob_789"]

# Optional date metadata (parallel arrays)
witness: ["[[Jane Doe]]"]
witness_id: ["jane_111"]
witness_from: ["1850"]
witness_to: ["1860"]
```

### Property Naming Convention

| Relationship Type | Properties |
|-------------------|------------|
| `godparent` | `godparent`, `godparent_id`, `godparent_from`, `godparent_to` |
| `mentor` | `mentor`, `mentor_id`, `mentor_from`, `mentor_to` |
| `witness` | `witness`, `witness_id`, `witness_from`, `witness_to` |
| etc. | Pattern: `{type}`, `{type}_id`, `{type}_from`, `{type}_to` |

### Design Decisions

1. **Notes field dropped** - Rarely used, can go in note body instead
2. **Parallel arrays for metadata** - `_from` and `_to` arrays align by index with main array
3. **Single values also supported** - `godparent: "[[John]]"` works (not just arrays)
4. **Matches existing family pattern** - Consistent with `spouse`, `stepfather`, etc.

### Benefits

1. **Obsidian Properties UI compatible** - All properties are simple lists or text
2. **Consistent** - Same pattern as existing family relationship properties
3. **User-friendly** - Easy to edit in Properties panel or Source mode
4. **No "type mismatch" warnings**

### Trade-offs

1. **More properties** - Users with many relationship types will have more frontmatter properties
2. **Parallel arrays** - Date metadata requires keeping arrays in sync (but rarely used)
3. **Migration needed** - Existing `relationships` arrays need migration

### Migration Strategy

1. **Read both formats** - Service reads old nested array AND new flat properties
2. **Write new format only** - UI writes flat properties
3. **Migration wizard** - Cleanup Wizard step to convert old → new
4. **Deprecation** - Warn when reading old format, encourage migration

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update `RelationshipService` to read flat properties
- [ ] Update `AddRelationshipModal` to write flat properties
- [ ] Remove `parseRelationshipsArrayForFamilyGraph()` from `family-graph.ts`
- [ ] Keep `includeOnFamilyTree`/`familyGraphMapping` on type definitions (still useful)
- [ ] Add migration wizard step
- [ ] Update documentation
