**Components Used:**

| Section | Component | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Title block | Centered title + date range | |
| Summary | Inline statistics card | Event/participant/place counts |
| Year headers | Section header | When grouping by year |
| Event cards | Timeline entry card | Date, type, participants, place |

**Timeline Entry Card:**

```typescript
function buildTimelineEntry(event: TimelineEvent): Content {
  return {
    stack: [
      // Date header
      { text: formatDate(event.date), style: 'timelineDate' },
      { canvas: [{ type: 'line', ... }] }, // separator
      // Event type
      { text: event.type.toUpperCase(), style: 'timelineType' },
      // Participants
      { text: event.participants.join(' and '), style: 'timelineParticipants' },
      // Place
      { text: event.place, style: 'timelinePlace', color: '#666666' },
      // Source (if enabled)
      event.source ? { text: `Source: ${event.source}`, style: 'timelineSource' } : null
    ].filter(Boolean),
    margin: [0, 8, 0, 8],
    // Light border or background
  };
}
```

**Grouping Variants:**

| Grouping | Section Headers | Entry Format |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| None | No headers | All entries chronological |
| By Year | "1850", "1851", etc. | Entries under year |
| By Decade | "1850s", "1860s", etc. | Entries under decade |
| By Person | Person names | Their events listed |
| By Place | Place names | Events at that place |

```

**Components Used:**

| Section | Component | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Title block | Centered title | Place name |
| Place details | Key-value card | Type, hierarchy, coordinates |
| Summary | Inline statistics | Event/people counts, date range |
| Births | Section header + data table | Name, date, parents |
| Deaths | Section header + data table | Name, date, age |
| Marriages | Section header + data table | Couple, date, venue |
| Residences | Section header + data table | Name, period |
| Events | Section header + data table | All other events |

**Hierarchy Display:**

```typescript
function formatPlaceHierarchy(place: PlaceInfo): string {
  // "Dublin → County Dublin → Leinster → Ireland"
  const chain = getPlaceHierarchyChain(place);
  return chain.map(p => p.name).join(' → ');
}
```

### New Styles to Add

Add these styles to the shared `pdfStyles` object:

```typescript
const extendedReportStyles = {
  // Timeline-specific
  timelineDate: { fontSize: 11, bold: true, color: '#333333' },
  timelineType: { fontSize: 10, bold: true, color: '#555555', margin: [0, 4, 0, 2] },
  timelineParticipants: { fontSize: 10 },
  timelinePlace: { fontSize: 9, italics: true, color: '#666666' },
  timelineSource: { fontSize: 8, color: '#888888', margin: [0, 4, 0, 0] },

  // Source Summary-specific
  qualityPrimary: { color: '#2e7d32' },      // Green
  qualitySecondary: { color: '#f57c00' },    // Amber
  qualityDerivative: { color: '#757575' },   // Gray
  unsourcedWarning: { color: '#d32f2f' },    // Red

  // Place Summary-specific
  hierarchyChain: { fontSize: 9, color: '#666666' },
  coordinates: { fontSize: 9, color: '#888888', font: 'Courier' }
};
```

## Technical Considerations

### PDF Rendering

All new reports use the existing PDF infrastructure:
- Reuse shared helper functions (`buildSectionHeader`, `buildDataTable`, etc.)
- Follow established styling guide (colors, typography, layout)
- Support same output options (Save to vault, Download as MD, Download as PDF)

### Data Aggregation

**Source Summary:**
- Collect all `sources_*` properties from person frontmatter
- Resolve source wikilinks to source notes
- Extract quality classification and citation details
- Group by fact type (requires parsing citation context)

**Timeline:**
- Query all events within date range
- Sort by date (handling partial/unknown dates)
- Resolve participants and places
- Handle fictional dates if universe has custom calendar

**Place Summary:**
- Use `PlaceGraphService.getPlaceHierarchy()` for containment
- Query events with matching `place` field
- Query persons with matching birth/death/residence places
- Aggregate child place data if option enabled

### Performance

For large vaults:
- Lazy load report data (don't precompute on modal open)
- Show progress indicator for reports spanning many entities
- Consider pagination for very long reports (future)
