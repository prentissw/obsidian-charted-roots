# Create Person Enhancements

Planning document for enhancing person creation and editing workflows.

- **Status:** Planning (Phase 1 scoped for v0.18.1)
- **GitHub Issue:** #TBD
- **Created:** 2025-12-18
- **Updated:** 2025-12-28

## Overview

The core problem: **Building a family tree from scratch requires constant jumping in and out of modals.**

A new user scenario illustrates this:
> "I know my wife, I know my kids, I know my parents. Who should I create first? I was hoping to start with anyone and create additional parents/kids up and down the tree without having to save and exit out of the screen for the person you are editing/creating, click another edit/create button, look up another person, edit them, jump out of that screen to go look up another person, jumping round and round."

The current workflow forces users into a tedious loop:
1. Create Person A → Save → Close
2. Create Person B → Save → Close
3. Edit Person A to link B as spouse → Save → Close
4. Create Child C → Save → Close
5. Edit Child C to set parents → Save → Close
6. ...repeat endlessly

**Goal:** Enable continuous family creation without leaving the modal flow.

---

## Phase 1: Inline Person Creation (v0.18.1)

Allow creating new family members directly from within the Create/Edit Person modal.

### Core Feature: "Create New" in Person Pickers

When selecting a father, mother, spouse, or child, offer a "Create new person" option that:
1. Opens a sub-modal to create the new person
2. Automatically creates the note
3. Returns to the parent modal with the new person linked
4. User never loses context of who they're editing

### Scope

1. **Inline creation for all relationship fields**
   - Father picker: "Create new father" option
   - Mother picker: "Create new mother" option
   - Spouse picker: "Create new spouse" option
   - (Children picker deferred to Phase 2)

2. **Smart defaults for new inline persons**
   - Creating a father → pre-fill `sex: male`
   - Creating a mother → pre-fill `sex: female`
   - Creating a spouse → no sex pre-fill (unknown)

3. **Simplified sub-modal (QuickCreatePersonModal)**
   - Fields: name (required), sex (pre-filled where applicable), birth date (optional)
   - "Create and link" button creates note and returns to parent modal
   - No relationship fields in sub-modal (avoids nesting complexity)
   - Uses same directory as parent modal context

### Design Decisions

1. **Sub-modal is simplified, not full CreatePersonModal**
   - Rationale: Full modal would allow infinite nesting (create father → create father's father → etc.)
   - Quick create covers 90% of use cases; user can edit full details later
   - Matches PlacePickerModal's inline create pattern

2. **Single-level nesting only (v1)**
   - Sub-modal does not offer its own "Create new" options
   - User creates one person, returns to parent, can repeat as needed
   - Future: Could allow deeper nesting if requested

3. **No "recent creations" section (v1)**
   - Keep UI simple initially
   - Sort by "recently modified" already surfaces new people
   - Future: Add if users request it

### UI Flow

```
CreatePersonModal
  └── Father field → [Link] button
        └── PersonPickerModal
              ├── Search existing people
              ├── [+ Create new father] ← NEW
              │     └── QuickCreatePersonModal (name, sex=male, birth date)
              │           └── [Create and link] → creates note, returns PersonInfo
              └── Select existing person
```

### Implementation Notes

- Add `onCreateNew?: (context: RelationshipContext) => void` callback to PersonPickerModal
- New `QuickCreatePersonModal` class - minimal fields, single "Create and link" button
- Context passed to callback includes: relationship type, parent person's cr_id, suggested sex
- On creation: write note via `createPersonNote()`, return `PersonInfo` to picker
- Picker auto-selects newly created person and closes

### Implementation Checklist

#### Phase 1a: QuickCreatePersonModal
- [x] Create `src/ui/quick-create-person-modal.ts`
- [x] Minimal form: name (required), sex dropdown, birth date (optional)
- [x] Accept `suggestedSex` and `directory` options
- [x] "Create and link" button calls `createPersonNote()` and returns `PersonInfo`
- [x] ~~Add `ModalStatePersistence` support~~ — Skipped: modal is ephemeral by design
- [x] Add styles to `styles.css` (reuse existing `.crc-form` classes)

#### Phase 1b: PersonPickerModal Enhancement
- [x] Add `onCreateNew` callback option to `PersonPickerModal` constructor
- [x] Add `RelationshipContext` interface: `{ relationshipType, suggestedSex?, parentCrId?, directory? }`
- [x] Render "+ Create new person" button at top of results (or in header)
- [x] Button click opens `QuickCreatePersonModal` with context
- [x] On sub-modal close with result, call `onSelect` with new `PersonInfo`

#### Phase 1c: CreatePersonModal Integration
- [x] Update `createRelationshipField()` to pass `onCreateNew` to picker
- [x] Map field type to suggested sex: father→male, mother→female, spouse→undefined
- [x] Pass current directory to quick create modal
- [x] Test: create person, add father via picker, create new father inline

#### Phase 1d: Step/Adoptive Parents
- [x] Extend to stepfather, stepmother, adoptive father, adoptive mother fields
- [x] Same pattern: pre-fill sex based on field type

#### Phase 1e: Folder Context Menu
- [x] Add "Create person" to People folder context menu (Canvas Roots submenu)
- [x] Pass clicked folder path as `directory` option to CreatePersonModal
- [x] Works for People folder and any subfolder within it

## Phase 2: Add Children Section to Edit Modal ✅ (v0.18.1)

> **Status:** Implemented

Add the ability to view and manage children directly from the Edit Person modal.

### Context

- The plugin already has `child` frontmatter property and bidirectional linking
- Setting `father: [[John]]` on Jane's note automatically adds `[[Jane]]` to John's `child` array
- Users want to link existing children from the parent's perspective (batch operation)
- Combined with Phase 1, this enables creating new children inline

### Scope

1. **Children section in Edit mode** ✅
   - Add "Children" section with multi-select person picker
   - Display currently linked children (from `child` array)
   - Allow adding existing children or creating new ones (via Phase 1)
   - Shows in Edit mode when children exist or always in Edit mode

2. **Parent field auto-detection** ✅
   - When adding children, auto-detect which parent field to set based on parent's `sex` field
   - Male → set child's `father` field
   - Female → set child's `mother` field
   - Unknown/other → skip auto-setting (user can manually set in child's note)

3. **Bidirectional sync** ✅
   - Adding child to parent's `child` array triggers bidirectional linker
   - Child's `father`/`mother` field updated automatically via `syncChildToParent()`
   - Removing child updates both directions

### Implementation Details

- Children section added to `CreatePersonModal` in Edit mode
- Uses `MultiRelationshipField` interface for managing multiple children
- `PersonPickerModal` used for child selection with inline creation support
- `BidirectionalLinker.syncChildToParent()` handles child → parent sync based on parent's sex
- `BidirectionalLinker.removeParentFromChild()` handles deletion sync (clears child's parent field when removed from parent)
- `person-note-writer.ts` updated to handle `childCrId`/`childName` in `updatePersonNote()`

### Open Questions (Deferred)

1. Should we filter candidate children to exclude people already linked to another parent of the same type?
2. Should there be a confirmation when adding many children at once?

---

## Phase 3: "Add Another" Flow ✅ (v0.18.1)

> **Status:** Implemented

After creating a person, the modal now shows quick actions to continue building the family.

### Implementation

When user clicks "Create person":
1. Person note is created and opened
2. Modal transforms to show "Person created!" success message
3. Three action buttons appear: **Add spouse**, **Add child**, **Add parent**
4. **Done** button closes the modal

Each action opens a person picker (with inline creation support via Phase 1):
- Add spouse → Opens spouse picker, adds to created person's `spouse` array
- Add child → Opens child picker, adds to created person's `child` array
- Add parent → Shows father/mother choice, then opens parent picker

After adding a relationship, the user returns to the action panel to add more or click Done.

### Benefits

- Natural workflow: "I just created John, now let me add his wife and kids"
- Reduces navigation and context-switching
- Builds on Phase 1 and 2 infrastructure

## Phase 4: Family Creation Wizard (Future)

> **Standalone feature:** Does not depend on Phases 1-3. Addresses a different use case (batch family creation from scratch).

A dedicated wizard for creating an entire nuclear family at once.

### Motivation

For users starting completely fresh, a guided flow could be faster than creating individuals one at a time. The wizard collects all family member information upfront, then creates all notes with relationships automatically linked.

### Wizard Steps

1. **Start:** Choose mode (start from scratch vs. build around existing person)
2. **Step 1:** Create central person (name, nickname, sex, birth date)
3. **Step 2:** Add spouse(s) - supports multiple
4. **Step 3:** Add children
5. **Step 4:** Add parents (father and mother)
6. **Step 5:** Review - visual family tree preview, stats summary, confirm
7. **Complete:** Success message with list of created notes

### Entry Points

1. **Command palette** - `Canvas Roots: Create family wizard`
2. **Control Center Dashboard** - Quick action tile (replaces Reports tile after merging into Statistics)
3. **Control Center Tools category** - "Create Family" tool entry in sidebar
4. **Control Center People tab > Actions card** - Button alongside "Create person"
5. **People folder context menu** - "Create family" in Canvas Roots submenu

### Bundled Change: Merge Statistics and Reports

To make room for "Create Family" on the Dashboard while keeping 12 tiles:
- Rename "Statistics" tool to "Statistics & Reports"
- Update description to cover both data analysis and report generation
- Remove separate "Reports" tool entry
- Statistics dashboard already has or can link to report generation

### Implementation Checklist

#### Entry Points
- [ ] Add command: `Canvas Roots: Create family wizard`
- [ ] Add "Create Family" tile to Dashboard (after removing Reports)
- [ ] Add "Create Family" to TOOL_CONFIGS in lucide-icons.ts
- [ ] Add "Create family" button to People tab Actions card
- [ ] Add "Create family" to People folder context menu

#### Statistics/Reports Consolidation
- [ ] Rename "Statistics" to "Statistics & Reports" in TOOL_CONFIGS
- [ ] Update description to mention reports
- [ ] Remove "Reports" entry from TOOL_CONFIGS

#### Wizard Modal
- [ ] Create `src/ui/family-creation-wizard.ts`
- [ ] Implement step-based navigation with state management
- [ ] Step 1: Central person form (reuse QuickCreatePersonModal patterns)
- [ ] Step 2: Spouse list with add/edit/remove
- [ ] Step 3: Children list with add/edit/remove
- [ ] Step 4: Parents (father/mother) with add/edit/remove
- [ ] Step 5: Review with family tree visualization and stats
- [ ] Batch note creation with relationship linking
- [ ] Completion screen with created notes list

#### Styles
- [ ] Add wizard-specific styles to styles.css
- [ ] Step indicator styles
- [ ] Person card list styles
- [ ] Family tree preview styles

### Alternative: Tabbed Modal

Instead of a full wizard, consider a tabbed modal for the Create/Edit Person form:
- Keeps everything in one place
- Organized into collapsible/tabbed sections
- Less disruptive than step-by-step wizard
- Better for quick edits

### Proposed Sections (if tabbed)

| Section | Fields |
|---------|--------|
| **Basic** | Name, sex, nicknames, cr_id |
| **Dates & Places** | Birth date + place, death date + place, living status |
| **Family** | Father, mother, spouses, children |
| **Extended** | Occupations, custom relationships, sources |
| **Options** | Target folder, filename format, dynamic blocks |

### When to Implement

This becomes valuable when:
- Modal complexity continues to grow
- Users report feeling overwhelmed by the form
- Need to add more relationship types or source linking
- Mobile users need simplified entry flow

## Bundled Enhancement: Nickname Property Support

> **Standalone feature:** Can be implemented independently. Bundled here for v0.18.1 release.
>
> **GitHub Issue:** [#46](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-canvas-roots/issues/46)

Add `nickname` as a first-class frontmatter property on Person notes, with import support.

### Motivation

Users want to capture informal names, aliases, and nicknames:
- "Bobby" for "Robert"
- "Gram" for grandmother
- Stage names, pen names, or titles used in daily life

The `nickname` property already exists in the property alias system (with aliases `alias`, `known_as`, `goes_by`), but:
- It's not in the `PersonData` interface
- Importers don't populate it
- Create/Edit Person modal doesn't show it

### Scope

1. **PersonData interface** — Add `nickname?: string` field
2. **Person note writer** — Write `nickname` to frontmatter when present
3. **Import support**
   - Gramps: Map `nick` element to `nickname` (already parsed, not written)
   - GEDCOM: Map `NICK` tag to `nickname`
   - GEDCOM X: Check for nickname in names array
4. **Create/Edit Person modal** — Add optional nickname field

### Implementation Checklist

#### Nickname Infrastructure
- [x] Add `nickname?: string` to `PersonData` interface in `person-note-writer.ts`
- [x] Add nickname writing logic to `createPersonNote()`
- [x] Add nickname update logic to `updatePersonNote()`

#### Import Support
- [x] Gramps importer: Populate `nickname` from parsed `nick` field
- [x] GEDCOM importer: Parse and populate `NICK` tag
- [x] GEDCOM X importer: Check for nickname name type

#### Modal Integration
- [x] Add nickname field to CreatePersonModal (optional, after name field)
- [x] Add nickname field to QuickCreatePersonModal (optional)

## Completed Enhancements

### Place Picker Integration ✅ (v0.14.x)

- Added place picker for birth/death places
- Link button opens place picker modal
- Create new place inline if none exists
- Dual storage: wikilink in `birth_place`, cr_id in `birth_place_id`

### Field Reordering ✅ (v0.14.x)

- Grouped related fields logically:
  - Birth date + Birth place
  - Death date + Death place

---

## Known Limitations to Address

### Multiple Spouses in Edit Modal ✅ (v0.18.1)

> **Status:** Implemented

The CreatePersonModal now supports multiple spouses using the same multi-select pattern as children:

- Edit mode shows `createSpousesField()` with add/remove UI
- Create mode shows simplified single-spouse picker (adds to array internally)
- Full support for viewing, adding, and removing multiple spouses

---

## Out of Scope: Custom Relationships

This plan focuses on **family relationships** (father, mother, spouse, children), which are stored as dedicated frontmatter properties. **Custom relationships** are intentionally out of scope.

### Why Custom Relationships Are Separate

| Aspect | Family Relationships | Custom Relationships |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Storage** | Individual properties (`father`, `mother`, `spouse`, `child`) | `relationships` array in frontmatter |
| **Modal** | `CreatePersonModal` | `AddRelationshipModal` |
| **Entry point** | Create/Edit Person flow | Separate action on existing person note |
| **Types** | Fixed (biological/step/adoptive parents, spouse, child) | Configurable via `RelationshipService` |

Custom relationships are added via `AddRelationshipModal` after a person exists. The inline creation pattern (creating people while picking them) doesn't apply because:

1. Custom relationship targets must already exist to be meaningful
2. The modal flow is different (select type → select target → add notes)
3. Custom relationships are typically added later, not during initial person creation

### Future Consideration

Phase 4 (Tabbed Modal) mentions an "Extended" section that could include custom relationships. If users request managing custom relationships from within the Create/Edit Person modal, that would be a separate enhancement building on the existing `AddRelationshipModal` infrastructure.
