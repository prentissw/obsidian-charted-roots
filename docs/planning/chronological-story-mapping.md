# Chronological Story Mapping

> **Status:** Planned
> **Target Version:** TBD
> **Last Updated:** 2025-12-06

## Overview

Chronological Story Mapping introduces event-based timeline visualization to Canvas Roots, enabling users to document and visualize life events in chronological order. The feature supports both genealogists (who derive events from sources) and worldbuilders (who create canonical events directly).

## User Research Insights

Based on user feedback (December 2025), the following priorities emerged:

### Core Requirements

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Events should be promotable from embedded text to standalone notes seamlessly. Users want `born: 1976` convertible to `born: [[1976]]` without friction.

2. **Flexibility Over Structure**: Support for partial/incomplete data that evolves over time. The `date_precision` property is highly valued for handling uncertain dates.

3. **Relative Ordering Without Exact Dates**: Critical requirement - users need to express "Event A happened before B but after C" even without knowing actual dates. This enables meaningful timelines from incomplete research.

4. **Event Relationships**: Support for prev/next relationships between events (like periodic notes chains), and parent/child relationships (events → timelines → eras → calendars).

### Visualization Preferences

- **Gantt-style timeline view** with flexible zoom (eras → days)
- **Color-coding by period/era** on canvases
- **Graph-friendly structure** that can export to Canvas/Excalidraw
- **Custom sort property** based on timeline relationships for Bases sorting

### User Personas Update

The existing genealogist/worldbuilder personas should be supplemented with:

| Persona | Focus | Key Needs |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Writer/Plotter** | Narrative timeline for storytelling | Rearranging events, narrative event types (`plot_point`, `flashback`), flexible ordering |

Writers particularly value narrative event types and the ability to visualize story structure alongside chronology.

## Design Principles

### Events vs. Facts

**Events are occurrences; facts are assertions about those occurrences.**

- An `event` is a discrete occurrence: "John was born on March 15, 1850 in Dublin"
- A `fact` in a proof summary is an assertion: "I conclude John's birth date was March 15, 1850, based on these sources"

This distinction means:
- Person notes keep their current structure (no embedded `events` array)
- Events link *to* people via the `person` field, not the reverse
- Proof summaries can reference events as supporting evidence

### Dual-Path Creation

Different users have different workflows:

| User Type | Primary Workflow | Entry Point |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| Genealogist (casual) | "I found a document, let me record what it says" | Source → Extract events |
| Genealogist (power) | "I'm building a timeline to find research gaps" | Timeline → Create event → Attach sources |
| Worldbuilder (casual) | "This character did something interesting" | Person → Add life event |
| Worldbuilder (power) | "I need a coherent timeline for my universe" | Timeline → Batch create events |
| Writer/Plotter | "I need to visualize my story's timeline" | Timeline → Arrange events → Export to Canvas/Excalidraw |

## Event Schema

### Frontmatter Structure

```yaml
type: event
cr_id: "20251205123456"
title: "Birth of John Smith"
event_type: birth
date: 1850-03-15
date_precision: exact
person: "[[John Smith]]"
place: "[[Dublin, Ireland]]"
sources:
  - "[[1850 Birth Certificate]]"
confidence: high
description: "Born at 23 Grafton Street, Dublin"
```

### Field Definitions

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | `"event"` | Yes | Note type identifier |
| `cr_id` | string | Yes | Unique identifier |
| `title` | string | Yes | Display title for the event |
| `event_type` | EventType | Yes | Type of event (see below) |
| `date` | string | Yes | Event date (ISO format or fictional calendar) |
| `date_precision` | DatePrecision | Yes | How precise the date is |
| `person` | wikilink | No | Primary person involved |
| `persons` | wikilink[] | No | Multiple people (for marriages, etc.) |
| `place` | wikilink | No | Where the event occurred |
| `sources` | wikilink[] | No | Sources documenting this event |
| `confidence` | Confidence | No | Confidence level (default: `medium`) |
| `description` | string | No | Additional details |
| `is_canonical` | boolean | No | For worldbuilders: this is authoritative truth |
| `universe` | string | No | Fictional universe (for worldbuilding) |
| `date_system` | string | No | Fictional date system ID (for non-Gregorian dates) |
| `before` | wikilink[] | No | Events that happen after this one (for relative ordering) |
| `after` | wikilink[] | No | Events that happen before this one (for relative ordering) |
| `timeline` | wikilink | No | Parent timeline note this event belongs to |
| `sort_order` | number | No | Computed sort value for Bases (auto-generated from relationships) |

### Fictional Date System Integration

Events integrate with Canvas Roots' existing [Fictional Date Systems](../../wiki-content/Fictional-Date-Systems.md) feature. When `date_system` is specified, the `date` field is parsed using that system's era definitions.

**Example with Middle-earth Calendar:**
```yaml
type: event
cr_id: "20251205123456"
title: "Bilbo's Birthday Party"
event_type: anecdote
date: "TA 3001"
date_system: middle_earth
date_precision: year
person: "[[Bilbo Baggins]]"
place: "[[Bag End]]"
universe: "Middle-earth"
is_canonical: true
```

**Integration points:**
- `DateService.parseDate()` resolves fictional dates to `ParsedFictionalDate`
- `canonicalYear` from `ParsedFictionalDate` enables cross-era sorting
- Timeline views display dates using the appropriate era abbreviations
- Date picker in CreateEventModal offers era selection when a date system is active
- Universe-scoped date systems auto-select based on person's `universe` field

**Sorting across eras:**

The `canonicalYear` computed from `ParsedFictionalDate` enables correct chronological ordering even across different eras:

```typescript
// TA 3001 → canonicalYear = 3001 (Third Age epoch = 0)
// FoA 1   → canonicalYear = 3022 (Fourth Age epoch = 3021)
// Events sort correctly: TA 3001 < FoA 1
```

### Date Precision

```typescript
type DatePrecision =
  | 'exact'      // Known to the day: 1850-03-15
  | 'month'      // Known to the month: 1850-03
  | 'year'       // Known to the year: 1850
  | 'decade'     // Known to the decade: 1850s
  | 'estimated'  // Approximate: "circa 1850"
  | 'range'      // Between two dates: 1848-1852
  | 'unknown';   // Date unknown, use relative ordering
```

### Relative Ordering (Dateless Events)

A critical requirement from user research: support meaningful timelines even when exact dates are unknown. Events can specify their position relative to other events using `before` and `after` fields.

**Example: Immigration Timeline with Unknown Date**
```yaml
type: event
title: "Person A moved to the Americas"
event_type: immigration
date_precision: unknown
after:
  - "[[Marriage of Person A]]"    # We know this happened after marriage
before:
  - "[[Birth of First Child]]"    # We know this happened before first child
person: "[[Person A]]"
description: "Earlier than X date but later than Y date - actual date unknown"
```

**Sort Order Computation:**

The `sort_order` property is auto-computed from:
1. Exact dates (highest priority)
2. Relative ordering constraints (`before`/`after`)
3. Timeline membership
4. Manual override

This enables correct chronological ordering in Bases without requiring additional sorting values:

```typescript
// Topological sort resolves: Marriage → Immigration → Birth of Child
// Even though Immigration has no date, it sorts correctly based on constraints
```

**Graph Visualization:**

The `before`/`after` relationships create a directed graph that can be:
- Visualized in Obsidian's graph view (as links)
- Exported to Canvas with positioned nodes
- Exported to Excalidraw for further editing
- Displayed in a Gantt-style timeline with relative positioning

### Event Types

**Core types** (vital events):
- `birth` - Birth of a person
- `death` - Death of a person
- `marriage` - Marriage ceremony
- `divorce` - Divorce or annulment

**Extended types** (common life events):
- `residence` - Change of residence
- `occupation` - Employment or career change
- `military` - Military service event
- `immigration` - Immigration or emigration
- `education` - Educational milestone

**Narrative types** (for storytelling):
- `anecdote` - Family story or personal event
- `lore_event` - Worldbuilding canonical event
- `plot_point` - Key story beat or turning point
- `flashback` - Event referenced in non-chronological narrative
- `foreshadowing` - Event that sets up future developments
- `backstory` - Pre-narrative event that informs character/plot
- `climax` - Peak dramatic moment
- `resolution` - Story conclusion event

**Custom types**: Users can define additional event types via settings.

### Calendarium Plugin Integration

[Calendarium](https://github.com/javalent/calendarium) is a popular community plugin for custom fantasy/sci-fi calendars. Canvas Roots can optionally integrate with it for users who prefer Calendarium's richer calendar features.

**Calendarium API Access:**
```typescript
// Check if Calendarium is available
if (window.Calendarium) {
    const api = window.Calendarium;
    const calendars = api.getCalendars();  // List of calendar names
    const calApi = api.getAPI('Middle-earth');  // Calendar-specific API

    // Parse and format dates
    const date = calApi.parseDate('TA 3001');
    const display = calApi.toDisplayDate(date);

    // Query events
    const events = calApi.getEventsOnDay(date);
}
```

**Integration Modes:**

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Standalone** | Use Canvas Roots' built-in fictional date systems (default) |
| **Calendarium Primary** | Read calendars from Calendarium; Canvas Roots events sync to Calendarium |
| **Bidirectional** | Events visible in both systems; changes sync both ways |

**Data Mapping:**

| Canvas Roots Field | Calendarium Field |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| `date` | `fc-date` or `fc-start` |
| `date_end` (for ranges) | `fc-end` |
| `title` | `fc-display-name` |
| `description` | `fc-description` |
| `event_type` | `fc-category` (mapped to category ID) |

**Sync Behavior:**
- **Export to Calendarium**: Add `fc-*` frontmatter fields to event notes
- **Import from Calendarium**: Parse `fc-*` fields when loading events
- **Calendar Translation**: Use `calApi.translate(date, fromCal, toCal)` for cross-calendar events

**Settings:**
| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `calendariumIntegration` | `'none' \| 'read' \| 'sync'` | `'none'` | Integration mode |
| `calendariumDefaultCalendar` | string | `''` | Default Calendarium calendar for new events |
| `syncCalendariumEvents` | boolean | `false` | Show Calendarium events in Canvas Roots timelines |

**Implementation Notes:**
- Check `app.plugins.enabledPlugins.has('calendarium')` before accessing API
- Calendarium uses 0-indexed months; align with Canvas Roots' date parsing
- Calendarium's `CalDate` type: `{year: number, month: number, day: number}`
- Use `api.onSettingsLoaded(callback)` to defer initialization until Calendarium is ready

### New Reports in Data Quality Tab

- **Timeline gaps**: Periods with no documented events
- **Unsourced events**: Events without source citations
- **Orphan events**: Events not linked to any person

## Open Questions

1. **Event deduplication**: How to handle the same event documented by multiple sources? Should events merge or remain separate?
   - *Proposed*: Keep events separate but linkable. Multiple source citations on one event; or separate "observation" events that reference the same canonical event.

2. **Multi-person events**: For marriages, do we create one event linked to both people, or two events (one per person)?
   - *Proposed*: Single event with `persons` array for multi-person events. Appears in both people's timelines.

3. **Event inheritance**: Should children automatically inherit parent marriage events in their timeline?
   - *Proposed*: No automatic inheritance. Family Timeline view aggregates related events without duplicating data.

4. **Fictional calendar display**: How to sort events across different fictional calendar systems in a global timeline?
   - *Resolved*: Use `canonicalYear` from `ParsedFictionalDate` for cross-era sorting. Each date system defines epoch offsets.

5. **GEDCOM export**: How should events map to GEDCOM EVEN tags?
   - *Proposed*: Map event types to GEDCOM tags (BIRT, DEAT, MARR, etc.); custom types become EVEN with TYPE subtag.

6. **Event promotion workflow**: How should users "promote" an embedded date to an event note?
   - *User feedback*: Critical requirement. Should support seamless transition from `born: 1976` to `born: [[1976 Birth Event]]`.
   - *Proposed*: "Create event from property" action that generates event note and updates original property to wikilink.

7. **Timeline note type**: Should there be a `type: timeline` note to organize related events?
   - *User feedback*: Users want dedicated timeline/calendar notes as "single source of truth" for event collections.
   - *Proposed*: Add `type: timeline` with `events` array linking to event notes; serves as grouping container.
