## Overview

**Bases** provides a table-based interface for viewing and editing note properties, making it ideal for managing genealogical data:

- **Table View**: Edit multiple people at once in a spreadsheet-like interface
- **Filtering**: Focus on specific family members or data subsets
- **Formulas**: Calculate ages, lifespans, and other derived values
- **Sorting**: Organize by birth date, name, or any property
- **Summaries**: Aggregate statistics across your family tree

**Canvas Roots** reads the same YAML frontmatter properties that Bases edits, creating a powerful dual-entry workflow:

```
Individual Notes ←→ Bases Table View
         ↓
   Canvas Roots
         ↓
  Family Tree Visualization
```

## Why Use Bases with Canvas Roots?

### Bulk Data Entry
Edit multiple family members in a single table view instead of opening individual notes.

### Data Validation
Quickly spot missing data, inconsistencies, or errors across your entire family tree.

### Calculated Fields
Create formulas to automatically calculate:
- Current age of living members
- Lifespan of deceased members
- Generation spans
- Data completeness metrics

### Flexible Filtering
Create custom views for:
- Living vs. deceased members
- Members missing parent information
- Recently added people
- Specific generations or branches

## Quick Start

### 1. Enable Bases Plugin

Bases is a core Obsidian plugin:

1. Open Settings → Core plugins
2. Enable "Bases"

### 2. Copy the Template

Canvas Roots provides a ready-to-use Base template:

1. Navigate to `docs/assets/templates/family-members.base`
2. Copy the file to your vault
3. Rename it as desired (e.g., `My Family.base`)

### 3. Open the Base

Double-click the `.base` file to open the table view. You should see all notes with a `cr_id` property.

### 4. Start Editing

Click any cell to edit properties. Changes are immediately saved to the note's YAML frontmatter.

## Property Reference

Canvas Roots uses these core properties in note frontmatter:

### Required Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `cr_id` | String | Unique identifier (UUID) | `abc-123-def-456` |

### Relationship Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Example |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|
| `father` | Link | Link to father's note | `[[John Smith]]` |
| `mother` | Link | Link to mother's note | `[[Jane Doe]]` |
| `spouse` | Link or List | Link(s) to spouse(s) | `[[Mary Jones]]` or `["[[Mary]]", "[[Sarah]]"]` |

## Example Views

The template includes several pre-configured views:

### All Family Members
Default view showing everyone with a `cr_id`, sorted by birth date.

**Use case**: Overview of your entire family tree

### Living Members
Shows only people without a `died` date.

**Use case**: Focus on living relatives, calculate current ages

### Deceased Members
Shows only people with a `died` date.

**Use case**: Historical research, lifespan analysis

### Recently Added
Shows people added in the last 30 days.

**Use case**: Track recent research progress

### Missing Parents
Shows people without `father` or `mother` defined.

**Use case**: Identify gaps in your tree, prioritize research

### Incomplete Data
Shows people missing `born` or `name` properties.

**Use case**: Data quality checks

## Advanced Formulas

### Calculating Current Age

```yaml
formulas:
  age_now: 'if(born && !died, now().year() - born.year(), "")'
```

This calculates the age of living members based on their birth date.

### Lifespan Calculation

```yaml
formulas:
  full_lifespan: 'if(born && died, died.year() - born.year() + " years", "")'
```

Shows how many years a deceased person lived.

### Display Name Fallback

```yaml
formulas:
  display_name: 'name || file.name'
```

Shows the `name` property if present, otherwise uses the filename.

### Generation Span

```yaml
formulas:
  birth_decade: 'if(born, Math.floor(born.year() / 10) * 10 + "s", "")'
```

Groups people by the decade they were born in.

### Data Completeness

```yaml
formulas:
  completeness: '((!!name + !!born + !!died + !!father + !!mother) / 5 * 100).toFixed(0) + "%"'
```

Shows what percentage of core data fields are filled in.

### Relationship Count

```yaml
formulas:
  child_count: 'list(child).length'
  spouse_count: 'list(spouse).length'
```

Counts the number of children or spouses (handles both single values and arrays).

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Consistent Date Formats

Always use ISO format for dates: `YYYY-MM-DD`

✅ Good: `1888-05-15`
❌ Bad: `May 15, 1888` or `15/5/1888`

Bases can parse and manipulate ISO dates with built-in date functions.

### 2. Use Wikilinks for Relationships

Always use wikilink syntax for relationships:

✅ Good: `[[John Smith]]`
❌ Bad: `John Smith`

Wikilinks are automatically recognized as Link objects in Bases and are clickable.

### 3. Handle Arrays Consistently

For `spouse` and `child`, always use arrays if there's a possibility of multiple values:

```yaml
spouse: ["[[Mary Jones]]"]  # Array with one element
child: ["[[Bob]]", "[[Alice]]"]  # Array with multiple elements
```

This prevents issues when adding additional relationships later.

### 4. Tag Person Notes

Add a `#person` tag to all family member notes:

```yaml
---
tags:
  - person
cr_id: abc-123
---
```

This makes filtering easier and allows you to exclude non-person notes.

### 5. Use the `name` Property

While Canvas Roots can use the filename as a fallback, explicitly setting the `name` property gives you more flexibility:

```yaml
---
name: John Robert Smith
---
```

File can be renamed to `john-smith.md` without affecting display.

### 6. Create Multiple Views

Don't try to make one view do everything. Create specialized views for different tasks:

- **Data Entry View**: Minimal columns, easy to add new people
- **Research View**: All fields visible, sorted by missing data
- **Analysis View**: Formulas and summaries, sorted by patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Base Shows No Results

**Problem**: Base table is empty even though person notes exist.

**Solutions**:
1. Check that notes have the `cr_id` property
2. Verify the `filters` section in your `.base` file
3. Ensure notes are in the vault (not in `.obsidian` folder)

### Links Don't Work

**Problem**: Clicking a link in the base doesn't open the note.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you're using wikilink syntax: `[[Note Name]]`
2. Check that the linked note exists
3. Verify the link is in the note frontmatter (not just the base formula)

### Formulas Show Errors

**Problem**: Formula cells show `ERROR` or blank values.

**Solutions**:
1. Check formula syntax in the `.base` file
2. Verify property names are correct (case-sensitive)
3. Handle missing values with `if()` checks: `if(born, born.year(), "")`
4. Use `list()` function for properties that might be single values or arrays

### Changes Don't Appear in Canvas

**Problem**: Edited data in Bases doesn't show in Canvas Roots tree.

**Solutions**:
1. Run the "Re-Layout Current Canvas" command to refresh
2. Verify changes were saved to note frontmatter (open the note to check)
3. Check the Canvas is reading from the correct note files

### Arrays Display Strangely

**Problem**: Spouse or child arrays show as `[object Object]` or similar.

**Solutions**:
1. Use `.length` to count: `list(child).length`
2. Use `.join(", ")` to display as text: `list(spouse).map(s => s.toString()).join(", ")`
3. Create a formula to format the list properly

## Integration with Canvas Roots Workflow

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**: Create person notes with basic data (name, dates)
2. **Bulk Entry**: Use Bases to quickly add relationships and fill in missing data
3. **Visualization**: Run Canvas Roots to generate the family tree
4. **Refinement**: Identify gaps in the tree, use Bases to add missing people
5. **Re-layout**: Update the Canvas with new data
6. **Analysis**: Use Bases formulas to analyze patterns and data quality

### When to Use Bases vs. Individual Notes

**Use Bases when:**
- Adding multiple people at once
- Filling in the same property across many notes (e.g., adding birth dates)
- Finding patterns or missing data
- Doing data quality checks

**Use Individual Notes when:**
- Writing detailed biographical information
- Adding sources, images, or extensive notes
- Creating complex narrative content
- Linking to external research

### Bi-Directional Sync

If you enable bi-directional relationship sync in Canvas Roots settings:

1. Edit `father: [[John]]` in a Base
2. Canvas Roots automatically adds `child: [[Current Note]]` to John's note
3. The change appears immediately in the Base (if John is visible)
4. The Canvas tree reflects the new relationship when re-laid out

This ensures relationship consistency across your entire tree.
