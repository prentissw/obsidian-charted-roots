### Advanced UI

**Status**: ⏸️ Low Priority - Superseded by existing features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Person Detail Panel | Low priority | Largely redundant with Bases table views and opening notes directly |
| Rich inline person display | Low priority | Bases provides this; Family Chart View would do it better |
| Quick editing | Low priority | Bases inline editing covers this use case |
| Canvas export as image/PDF | ✅ Completed | PNG/SVG/PDF export in Family Chart View and Tree Preview (v0.3.1) |

The "relationship visualization" aspect originally planned for Person Detail Panel is better served by the **Interactive Family Chart View**, which provides full tree context rather than just immediate relatives.

### Interactive Family Chart View

**Status**: ✅ Completed in v0.3.0

A dedicated Obsidian leaf view that renders the full family-chart library interactively, complementing the static canvas output. Leverages the complete [family-chart](https://github.com/donatso/family-chart) API for rich genealogical visualization.

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Persistent leaf view (sidebar, new tab, or split pane)
- ✅ Full family-chart interactivity: pan, zoom, click-to-focus, smooth animated transitions
- ✅ Bidirectional sync with markdown notes (chart edits update frontmatter, frontmatter changes reflect in chart)
- ✅ Click node to open person note in editor
- ✅ Edit mode with inline relationship editing and undo/redo support
- ✅ Multiple color schemes: Gender, Generation, Collection, Monochrome
- ✅ Export as PNG, SVG, PDF with customizable filenames (v0.3.1)
- ✅ Toolbar UI: layout, color scheme, zoom, history, search
- ✅ Command: "Open family chart view", "Open current note in family chart"
- ✅ Context menu integration on person notes

### Custom Relationship Types

Define non-familial relationship types beyond the built-in parent/child/spouse relationships:

**Built-in + Custom Pattern:**
- Same approach as custom place types: built-in options plus user-defined
- Store in frontmatter as array: `relationships: [{type: "mentor", target: "[[Person]]"}, ...]`
- Reciprocal relationship handling (liege ↔ vassal, mentor ↔ apprentice)

**Example Relationship Categories:**
- **Feudal/political:** liege, vassal, sworn knight, ward, hostage
- **Religious/spiritual:** mentor, disciple, confessor, godparent
- **Professional:** master, apprentice, patron, protégé
- **Social:** rival, ally, betrothed, companion
- **Historical:** guardian, foster-parent (distinct from modern adoption)

**Canvas Visualization:**
- Render custom relationships as colored canvas edges (distinct from family edges)
- Configurable edge colors per relationship type in settings
- Toggle visibility of relationship types on canvas
- Optional edge labels showing relationship type
- Dashed vs. solid line styles to distinguish from family relationships

**Integration:**
- Bases views can filter/group by relationship type
- Relationship calculator could optionally traverse custom relationships
- Statistics panel showing relationship type distribution

### Schema Validation & Consistency Checks

User-defined property schemas to catch data inconsistencies and potential plot holes in world-building:

**JSON Schema Configuration:**
```json
// .obsidian/canvas-roots-schemas/house-stark.json
{
  "name": "House Stark Schema",
  "applies_to": {
    "collection": "House Stark",
    "house": "[[House Stark]]"
  },
  "required_properties": ["allegiance", "combat_style"],
  "properties": {
    "race": {
      "type": "enum",
      "values": ["human", "direwolf"],
      "default": "human"
    },
    "magic_type": {
      "type": "enum",
      "values": ["warging", "greensight", "none"],
      "required_if": { "has_magic": true }
    },
    "combat_style": {
      "type": "enum",
      "values": ["sword", "bow", "none"]
    }
  },
  "constraints": [
    {
      "rule": "if magic_type == 'greensight' then race != 'direwolf'",
      "message": "Direwolves cannot have greensight"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Validation Features:**
- Required properties by collection, house, or custom criteria
- Enum validation with allowed values lists
- Conditional requirements (`required_if` another property has certain value)
- Cross-property constraints with custom error messages
- Type validation (string, number, date, wikilink, array)
- Default value suggestions for missing properties

**Integration:**
- Pre-visualization validation hook (warn before rendering)
- Data Quality tab shows schema violations alongside genealogical issues
- Batch "fix missing properties" action with default value insertion
- Per-schema enable/disable toggle
- Schema editor UI in Control Center (or manual JSON editing)

**Use Cases:**

- `photo` - Photographs
- `correspondence` - Letters, postcards
- `newspaper` - Obituaries, announcements
- `military` - Service records, draft cards
- `immigration` - Passenger lists, naturalization
- `custom` - User-defined types

**Integration:**
- Bases views for source inventory across all people
- "Missing sources" report (people without linked evidence)
- Bulk source linking from folder of scanned documents
- OCR text extraction display (if available in file)
- Citation generator for common formats (Chicago, Evidence Explained)

### Canvas Media Nodes

Promote media files from inline embeddings to first-class canvas entities with semantic relationships and intelligent placement:

**Media Node Types:**
- `avatar` - Primary photo/portrait for a person (positioned adjacent to person node)
- `source` - Documentary evidence (clustered near related person or in source zone)
- `document` - Full document scans (birth certificate, will, etc.)
- `artifact` - Physical objects (heirlooms, gravestones, etc.)
- `custom` - User-defined media types

**Canvas Integration:**
```json
// Canvas JSON structure
{
  "type": "file",
  "file": "media/census-1900-smith.pdf",
  "cr_media_type": "source",
  "cr_linked_person": "person-uuid-123",
  "cr_source_date": "1900-06-01"
}
```

**Intelligent Placement:**
- Avatar nodes positioned immediately adjacent to person nodes
- Source nodes clustered in configurable zones (per-person, grouped by type, or edge of canvas)
- Layout engine respects media node placement during tree regeneration
- Toggle visibility by media type (show/hide all sources, show/hide avatars)

**Filtering & Analysis:**
- Filter canvas to show only media nodes matching criteria
- "Show sources for people born before 1900"
- "Show all military records"
- "Highlight people missing avatar photos"
- Media coverage report (people with/without linked sources)

**Edge Semantics:**
- Media → Person edges with relationship labels
- Edge styling distinct from family relationship edges
- Optional: media → media edges (e.g., "same document" linking multiple crops)

**Integration with Source Media Gallery:**
- Canvas media nodes sync with `sources` frontmatter property
- Gallery view shows which sources have been placed on canvas
- "Add to canvas" action from gallery view
- Bidirectional: adding media node to canvas updates frontmatter

### Transcript Nodes & Quotable Facts

Extract time-stamped, verifiable facts from audio/video sources with direct linking to the relevant moment:

**Structured Fact Properties:**
```yaml
---
# In person note frontmatter
oral_facts:
  - media: "[[Interview with Grandma.mp3]]"
    timestamp: "1m30s"
    fact_type: birth_date
    quote: "I was born on May 15th, 1922, in the old farmhouse"
    fact_id: "birth-001"
  - media: "[[Family Reunion 2019.mp4]]"
    timestamp: "45m12s"
    fact_type: residence
    quote: "We lived on Maple Street until I was twelve"
    fact_id: "residence-001"
---
```

**Timestamp Linking:**
- Deep links to specific moments: `[[Interview.mp3]]#t=1m30s`
- One-click playback from the exact timestamp
- Support for audio (mp3, wav, m4a) and video (mp4, webm) files
- Range support for longer quotes: `#t=1m30s-2m15s`

**Canvas Integration:**
- Transcript Nodes: specialized text nodes containing the quote
- Positioned adjacent to the relevant person node
- Edge label: "Quote Source" or custom fact type
- Distinct styling from other node types (e.g., speech bubble appearance)
- Click node to jump to timestamp in media player

**Fact Types:**
- `birth_date`, `birth_place` - Vital record claims
- `residence` - Where someone lived
- `occupation` - Work history
- `relationship` - Family connection claims
- `anecdote` - Stories and memories
- `lore` - World-building/fictional narrative quotes
- `custom` - User-defined types

**World-Building Applications:**
- Extract character dialogue from recorded readings
- Capture legendary/mythological lore quotes
- Ensure consistent in-world narrative voice
- Build a quotable "lore bible" from source recordings

**Integration:**
- Oral facts sync with Source Media Gallery
- Canvas Media Nodes can reference specific timestamps
- Bases views for fact inventory by type
- "Unverified facts" report (claims without source timestamps)
- Transcript generation assistance (if external transcription exists)

**Interview Subject Graph:**

Map the relationship structure of interviews themselves with dedicated interview notes:

```yaml
---
# Interview note frontmatter
type: interview
cr_id: "interview-001"
title: "Andrew Wilson Interview 2019"
media: "[[Andrew Wilson Interview 2019.mp4]]"
date: 2019-08-15
location: "Portland, Oregon"

# Participants
interviewer: "[[Me]]"
interviewee: "[[Andrew Wilson]]"

# People mentioned in the interview
mentions:
  - person: "[[Sue Wilson Robinson]]"
    context: "sister"
    timestamps: ["3m20s", "15m45s", "42m10s"]
  - person: "[[Robert Wilson Sr]]"
    context: "father"
    timestamps: ["8m30s", "22m15s"]
  - person: "[[Mary Chen Wilson]]"
    context: "mother"
    timestamps: ["10m05s"]
---
```

**Canvas Visualization:**
- "Visualize interview context" command renders interview as central hub node
- Interviewee connected with primary edge (thick, labeled "subject")
- Mentioned people radiate outward with labeled edges ("mentioned", "discussed")
- Edge thickness or label indicates mention frequency
- Click edges to see timestamp list for that person's mentions
- Interview node styled distinctly (e.g., microphone icon, different color)

**Interview Index:**
- Bases view listing all interviews with participant counts
- "People by interview coverage" report (who has been interviewed, who hasn't)
- Cross-reference: which interviews mention a specific person
- Timeline view of interviews by date

**Use Cases:**
- Oral history projects with multiple interview subjects
- Podcast episode tracking for genealogy shows
- Research interview management
- Documentary source tracking

**Chronological Story Mapping (Timeline Integration):**

Transform extracted oral history facts into timeline events that integrate with Leaflet.js Time Slider and dedicated timeline views:

```yaml
---
# Event object generated from oral fact extraction
type: event
cr_id: "evt-qom515nql022"
date: 1949-04-05
date_precision: month  # year | month | day | approximate
description: "Moved to California"
person: "[[Andrew Wilson]]"
person_id: "person-uuid-123"
place: "[[California]]"
place_id: "place-california-001"

# Source linkage
source_type: oral_history
source_media: "[[Interview 1.mp4]]"
source_timestamp: "5m0s"
source_quote: "I moved to California in 1949, right after the war ended"
source_fact_id: "residence-001"

# Event classification
event_type: residence_change  # birth | death | marriage | residence_change | occupation | military | immigration | custom
confidence: medium  # high | medium | low | uncertain
---
```

**Fact-to-Event Translation:**
- Extract date from quote context ("in 1949", "after the war", "when I was twelve")
- Infer date precision (year only vs. specific date)
- Link to existing place notes or create new ones
- Preserve source linkage for verification
- Flag uncertain dates for review

**Timeline Integration:**
- Events populate Leaflet.js Time Slider for geographic animation
- Dedicated Markdown Timeline view (vertical chronological display)
- Filter by person, place, event type, or confidence level
- Click event to jump to source timestamp
- Visual distinction between verified vs. extracted dates

**Event Types:**
- `birth`, `death` - Vital events (usually from frontmatter, but can be oral)
- `marriage`, `divorce` - Relationship changes
- `residence_change` - Moving to new location
- `occupation` - Job changes, career milestones
- `military` - Enlistment, discharge, deployments
- `immigration` - Border crossings, naturalization
- `education` - Graduation, enrollment
- `anecdote` - Story moments without specific date
- `lore_event` - World-building timeline events (fictional)

**Extraction Workflow:**
1. User captures oral fact with quote and timestamp
2. "Convert to timeline event" action parses the fact
3. Date extraction suggests date and precision
4. User confirms/adjusts date, place, and event type
5. Event note created and linked to person
6. Timeline views automatically include new event

**Timeline Views:**
- **Person Timeline:** All events for one person, chronologically
- **Family Timeline:** Events for a family group, interleaved
- **Place Timeline:** All events at a specific location
- **Global Timeline:** All events, filterable by criteria

**World-Building Applications:**
- Build narrative timelines from character dialogue
- Track in-world historical events from lore recordings
- Visualize story chronology across multiple characters
- Identify timeline inconsistencies (plot holes)

**Integration:**
- Events sync with person note's `events` frontmatter array
- Leaflet.js map animates event markers along timeline
- Bases views for event inventory by type, person, or date range
- "Timeline gaps" report (periods with no recorded events)
- Export timeline to external formats (JSON-LD, GEDCOM events)

### Interactive Canvas Features

**Status**: ⏸️ Reconsidered - See Interactive Family Chart View

Most interactive canvas features are not feasible with Obsidian's current Canvas API, which lacks programmatic viewport control and event hooks. The Canvas is designed as a user-manipulated workspace, not a programmatically-controlled visualization.

| Feature | Feasibility | Issue |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Hover tooltips | 🟡 Hacky | No official API; requires fragile DOM manipulation |
| Minimap | 🔴 Difficult | No viewport state access |
| Zoom to person | 🔴 Difficult | No programmatic viewport control |
| Highlight paths | 🟡 Hacky | Edge SVG manipulation possible but fragile |
| Collapsible branches | 🔴 Very difficult | Would require hide/show plus layout recalculation |
| Click-to-focus | 🔴 Difficult | Same viewport control limitation |

**Recommended Alternative**: The **Interactive Family Chart View** (see above) provides all these features natively by rendering family-chart directly in a dedicated Obsidian leaf view, bypassing Canvas API limitations entirely. Canvas remains valuable for static, printable output with Obsidian-native file linking.

### Alternative Layout Algorithms

- ✅ **Compact layout** - 50% tighter spacing for large trees (v0.2.3-beta)
- ✅ **Timeline layout** - Chronological positioning by birth year (v0.2.3-beta)
- ✅ **Hourglass layout** - Ancestors above, descendants below root person (v0.2.3-beta)
- Fan chart (circular ancestor view) - Deferred due to Canvas rectangular node constraints
- Bow-tie layout for showing connections between families

### Dynasty Management

- Succession tracking (line of succession calculator)
- Title/position inheritance
- Royal/noble house visualization
- Coat of arms and heraldry support
- Regnal numbering (King Henry VIII, etc.)
- Crown succession rules (primogeniture, ultimogeniture, etc.)

### Faction Relationships

- Alliance and conflict tracking between groups
- Political marriage networks
- Power structure hierarchies
- Faction-based coloring and visualization
- Inter-faction relationship mapping

### Import/Export Enhancements

**Status**: ✅ Complete in v0.5.1

**Implemented:**
- ✅ CSV bulk import/export (v0.3.3)
