## 🎯 Current Status (v0.1.1)

### ✅ Implemented Features

**Core Functionality:**
- TypeScript-based plugin foundation with Obsidian API integration
- Control Center modal UI for plugin management
- GEDCOM import with person note generation
- Dual storage relationship system (wikilinks + `cr_id` references)
- Bidirectional relationship linking
- Structured logging system with export capability

**Tree Generation:**
- Genealogical layout engine using [family-chart](https://github.com/donatso/family-chart) library for automated positioning
- Canvas generation from person notes with proper handling of complex relationships
- Multiple tree types: ancestors (pedigree), descendants, full family tree
- Generation limits and spouse inclusion controls
- Vertical and horizontal layout directions

**Canvas Management:**
- Canvas regeneration command for updating existing trees with current data
- Context menu integration (right-click on canvas files, tabs, or three-dot menu)
- Metadata preservation during regeneration
- Re-layout command with settings integration

**UI & Workflow:**
- Streamlined Tree Generation tab with inline person browser
- Person search, sort, and filter capabilities
- Multi-family detection and automatic family group organization
- "Generate all trees" command for batch tree creation
- Integrated generation workflow with single-card interface

**Styling & Customization:**
- Comprehensive canvas styling options within JSON Canvas spec
- Node coloring: gender-based, generation-based, or monochrome
- Arrow styles: directed, bidirectional, undirected
- Edge colors for parent-child and spouse relationships
- Settings interface for layout customization and logging control

**Multiple Spouse Support:**
- Flat indexed YAML properties (`spouse1`, `spouse2`, etc.)
- Marriage metadata: dates, locations, status (divorced, widowed, etc.)
- Optional spouse edge display with configurable labels
- Canvas Settings toggle for showing/hiding spouse edges
- Label formats: none, date-only, date-location, full

**Data Management:**
- Obsidian Bases template with one-click creation

- YAML-first data storage for maximum compatibility
- Robust error handling in GEDCOM import

## 🚧 In Progress

### Collections Management (v0.2.0-beta)

**Phase 1: Component Naming**
- Add `collection_name` property support to person notes
- Update UI to show custom names instead of "Family 1", "Family 2"
- Implement naming conflict resolution (most common name wins)

**Architecture:**
- Dual system: detected components (computed) + user collections (stored)
- Zero configuration required (flat vaults fully supported)
- Self-healing data (component membership computed from relationships)

See [architecture/collections.md](architecture/collections.md) for complete ADR.

## 📋 Planned Features

### Phase 1.5: Context Menu Actions (v0.1.2-alpha)

**Person Notes (Right-click):**
- "Add relationship..." - Quick submenu to add parent, spouse, or child using person picker
- "Validate relationships" - Check for broken cr_id references and orphaned links
- "Find on canvas" - Jump to this person on any canvas where they appear

**Folders (Right-click):**
- "Set as people folder" - One-click configuration of settings.peopleFolder
- "Import GEDCOM to this folder" - Pre-select folder for GEDCOM import
- "Scan for relationship issues" - Batch validation of all person notes in folder

**Canvas Files (Right-click on tab/file):**
- "Regenerate canvas" - Re-run layout algorithm with current relationship data (✅ Implemented)
- "Show tree statistics" - Quick modal with person count, generation depth, edge count

> **Note:** Canvas views don't currently support context menus inside the canvas editor itself (Obsidian API limitation). All canvas actions must be accessed by right-clicking the canvas file tab or in the file explorer.

### Phase 2: Collections (v0.3.0-beta)

- Sharing with other genealogy software

### Phase 4: Reference Numbering (v0.5.0)

- Ahnentafel numbering system support
- Dollarhide-Cole numbering system support
- d'Aboville descendant numbering
