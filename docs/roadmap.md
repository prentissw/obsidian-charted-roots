### Advanced UI

**Status**: ⏸️ Low Priority - Superseded by existing features

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Person Detail Panel | Low priority | Largely redundant with Bases table views and opening notes directly |
| Rich inline person display | Low priority | Bases provides this; Family Chart View would do it better |
| Quick editing | Low priority | Bases inline editing covers this use case |
| Canvas export as image/PDF | ✅ Completed | PNG/SVG/PDF export in Family Chart View and Tree Preview (v0.3.1) |

The "relationship visualization" aspect originally planned for Person Detail Panel is better served by the **Interactive Family Chart View**, which provides full tree context rather than just immediate relatives.

### Interactive Family Chart View

**Status**: ✅ Completed in v0.3.0

A dedicated Obsidian leaf view that renders the full family-chart library interactively, complementing the static canvas output. Leverages the complete [family-chart](https://github.com/donatso/family-chart) API for rich genealogical visualization.

**Implemented Features:**
- ✅ Persistent leaf view (sidebar, new tab, or split pane)
- ✅ Full family-chart interactivity: pan, zoom, click-to-focus, smooth animated transitions
- ✅ Bidirectional sync with markdown notes (chart edits update frontmatter, frontmatter changes reflect in chart)
- ✅ Click node to open person note in editor
- ✅ Edit mode with inline relationship editing and undo/redo support
- ✅ Multiple color schemes: Gender, Generation, Collection, Monochrome
- ✅ Export as PNG, SVG, PDF with customizable filenames (v0.3.1)
- ✅ Toolbar UI: layout, color scheme, zoom, history, search
- ✅ Command: "Open family chart view", "Open current note in family chart"
- ✅ Context menu integration on person notes

**Potential Future Enhancements:**
- Multiple chart views open simultaneously (different root persons)
- Linked views that stay synchronized
- Custom card components with Obsidian-specific actions
- Info popup integration showing person note preview
- Kinship labels display mode

### Privacy & Obfuscation

**Status**: ✅ Partially Completed in v0.2.9

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Living person privacy controls for GEDCOM exports
- ✅ Configurable birth year threshold (default: 100 years)
- ✅ Settings: `enableGedcomPrivacy`, `livingPersonThreshold`

**Planned:**
- Optional data obfuscation for canvas display
- PII protection for notes/canvas (beyond GEDCOM export)
- Configurable obfuscation rules for different export types

### Batch Operations

- Historical place name support

### Research Tracking

- Source documentation per fact (birth date source, death place source)
- Research progress indicators in Bases views
- DNA match tracking and ethnicity data
- "DNA confirmed" relationship tagging

### Interactive Canvas Features

**Status**: ⏸️ Reconsidered - See Interactive Family Chart View

Most interactive canvas features are not feasible with Obsidian's current Canvas API, which lacks programmatic viewport control and event hooks. The Canvas is designed as a user-manipulated workspace, not a programmatically-controlled visualization.

| Feature | Feasibility | Issue |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Hover tooltips | 🟡 Hacky | No official API; requires fragile DOM manipulation |
| Minimap | 🔴 Difficult | No viewport state access |
| Zoom to person | 🔴 Difficult | No programmatic viewport control |
| Highlight paths | 🟡 Hacky | Edge SVG manipulation possible but fragile |
| Collapsible branches | 🔴 Very difficult | Would require hide/show plus layout recalculation |
| Click-to-focus | 🔴 Difficult | Same viewport control limitation |

**Recommended Alternative**: The **Interactive Family Chart View** (see above) provides all these features natively by rendering family-chart directly in a dedicated Obsidian leaf view, bypassing Canvas API limitations entirely. Canvas remains valuable for static, printable output with Obsidian-native file linking.

### Alternative Layout Algorithms

- ✅ **Compact layout** - 50% tighter spacing for large trees (v0.2.3-beta)
- ✅ **Timeline layout** - Chronological positioning by birth year (v0.2.3-beta)
- ✅ **Hourglass layout** - Ancestors above, descendants below root person (v0.2.3-beta)
- Fan chart (circular ancestor view) - Deferred due to Canvas rectangular node constraints
- Bow-tie layout for showing connections between families

### Dynasty Management

- Succession tracking (line of succession calculator)
- Title/position inheritance
- Royal/noble house visualization
- Coat of arms and heraldry support
- Regnal numbering (King Henry VIII, etc.)
- Crown succession rules (primogeniture, ultimogeniture, etc.)

### Faction Relationships

- Alliance and conflict tracking between groups
- Political marriage networks
- Power structure hierarchies
- Faction-based coloring and visualization
- Inter-faction relationship mapping

### Import/Export Enhancements

**Status**: ✅ Partially Completed in v0.3.3

**Implemented:**
- ✅ CSV bulk import/export (v0.3.3)
- ✅ Selective export - specific branches only (v0.3.3)
- ✅ Privacy filters for living people (v0.2.9 for GEDCOM export)

**Planned:**
- FamilySearch GEDCOM X format support
- Gramps XML import
