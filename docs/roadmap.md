## 🚧 In Active Development

No features currently in active development. See Planned Features below for roadmap.

## 📋 Planned Features

### Bases Integration Improvements

- ✅ Children property in visible properties (Completed in v0.2.0-beta)
- ✅ Additional pre-configured Base views for common genealogy queries (Completed: Single Parents, Childless Couples, Multiple Marriages, Sibling Groups, Root Generation, Marked Root Persons)
- Enhanced error handling and validation for Base operations
- Collection management UI improvements in Bases views

### Ancestor/Descendant Lineage Tracking (Advanced Feature)

**Status**: Under consideration - requires design discussion

Compute and track multi-generational lineages from marked root persons to enable filtering and analysis of ancestor/descendant lines in Bases.

**Potential Approaches to Explore**:
- Generation number computation (command that traverses graph and writes properties)
- Lineage path tagging (mark people belonging to specific ancestral lines)
- Dynamic computation vs. stored properties tradeoffs
- Support for multiple root persons with overlapping lineages
- Integration with Bases filtering and views

**Questions to Address**:
- Property storage: How to handle multiple root persons per person?
- Update triggers: When to recompute (manual command, automatic sync, relationship changes)?
- Performance: Large trees with thousands of people
- User experience: Discoverability, configuration, maintenance
- Alternative approaches: Could reference numbering systems solve this differently?

**Related Features**:
- Reference numbering systems (Ahnentafel, d'Aboville) may provide overlapping functionality
- Canvas navigation features (ancestor/descendant canvas linking)

### Relationship History & Undo

- Command history modal tracking relationship changes made through Canvas Roots UI
- Manual undo commands to reverse recent relationship edits
- Relationship History panel showing recent changes with rollback options
- Change tracking for all relationship modifications (parent, spouse, child edits)

### Reference Numbering Systems

- Ahnentafel numbering system support
- Dollarhide-Cole numbering system support
- d'Aboville descendant numbering
